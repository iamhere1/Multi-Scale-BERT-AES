20719	" ""LAUGHTER""  @CAPS1 I hang out with my friends, the one thing we do best is laugh sometimes for no reason. The thing we tend to laugh about is running into trash cans, laundry or maybe even about what we ate for dinner the @TIME1 before. @CAPS1 I am usual stressed out the one thing I love is to hangout with my friends. they usual are good listeners. overall. Though they take your mind off things. So with my friends you can count on having a great time no matter what the occasion is.    @CAPS1 I say trash can I really mean trash cans I remember this one time in the hall way at school my friend was hanging on to my back pack because she tends to loose me in the hall way a lot because I walk a lot faster then her, anyways the class bell had just rouge an all the student were heading to lunch we were. I was just getting ready to cross the hall way an she said don't do it, so I did an nobody stopped! so she kinda slide into a trash can that was hanging on the wall in the hall way, she @MONTH1 have knocked it off but I can't really say? I was still walking an the sound effects were so funny I laugh at it still.       My friend an I have a inside joke? we went out to lunch together. @CAPS1 we saw a laundry mate an I minds went crazy, we made up a funny joke an said that we should make our self's aprons with lots color and rhinestones, so that way if we wanted to get all of our laundry done at the same time. We would take off our clothes there an put on our so called aprons. An do our laundry like it was nothing. @CAPS1 our laundry was done we said that we could pick out a new outfit because all of r close would be clean. yes we are weird but that is what makes us laugh more then anything is being silly an making up story just like that one.  Now about the food its sort of like the laundry but I guess better? I remember @CAPS1 i came to school the next day i just started talking about what i had for dinner @TIME1 i think at that time my mom had asked us if we wanted chicken @PERSON1 an my sister as i screamed an said hell yeah? so dinner was ready an @CAPS1 we went to go site at the table we looked at it an it was not what we expected it to be? it was frozen out of a box an it looked like somebody had eaten the food than puked it back up? it was that great looking.    All of these thing that have named or talked about is how my life is almost everyday @CAPS1 there not drama i love my friend I don't think I could have asked for a better one because all we do is laugh an have fun an fun in to trash can locker an whatever else there is but the one thing that matter the most with my one friend is that @CAPS1 we get in to a fight we can not stay mad at each other well I now that I can't. So at the end of the day I ask her are we done being made at each other? an than we just look at each other an laugh because that about all we can do because the reason was so stupid there was really no need for it.that is what a friend is to me having fun not worrying about what is around us. but just to have fun an be silly. not anybody else but are self's an sometime @CAPS1 we have are really goofy days? we make up the story about our laundry. talking about my life with my friends is nothing better than to laugh because deep down inside you an your friend will look back an say wow those where the best day was @CAPS1-would would get in trouble in class for talking way to much.

20725	" I believe that with all people laughter, and having a sense of humor, is something that generally everyone has in common, everyone loves to share with others. Among young teenage girls, laughter is a commodity that is infectious but always wonderful. It's the purest kind of joy we have, it's somethings that brings humans together. It's the beginning and end of friendship and unity. Laughter can ring out and lift the spirits of those that really need it. A simple laugh can make the worst day a little alright. We all know that feeling of dread, and sadness . The kindness, generosity, and good of laughter is one of the few things that are right nowadays. Even in poverty, depression, and oppression the simple joy of laughter can wash away a person's worries for a split second and fill us with utter warmth.  @PERSON1 and I have been the best of friends since we were ten-years-old, and laughter has always been our strongest element. @PERSON1 and I have a knack for making each other burst out in laughter when all we want to do is be angry or just cry. We've decided that apart, we're just a little funny, but with our powers combined we could make anyone laugh. We use that power on each other when we're having bad days, or we simply need some cheering up. I think if it wasn't for laughter we wouldn't even be friends anymore. It really is what brings us together as best friends. We'd be different people. Even if I drifted from her we'd always be cracking jokes, making each others guts hurt, and tearing up from laughing so hard.  My first impression of @PERSON1 was of her stomping down to our neighborhood park to yell at her sister, whom I had been playing with at the time. It would be a very self-explanatory reason of why I didn't like her at first. Luckily, after going to @PERSON1's house with her sister, @PERSON1 and I found that we had many things in common, and we were only four months apart. That childish kind of cajoling held our friendship together, for it was a bit rocky at the beginning. Always fighting, and arguing about things that now, we look back on and laugh at our adolescent stupidity. Either one of us would be popping off with dumb little comments at each other when neither of us wanted to apologize. One time she proceeded to tell me that I couldn't hear her because I had a big bug in my ear. Now we can remind each other of things like that and have a good ole time laughing about it. We were mere @NUM1-year-old's then. Now, almost @NUM2, we rarely fight, but we always laugh and make the best of what we've got with our poking fun. Laughter was definitely the band-aid in the beginning of our rickety friendship. @PERSON1 has a gift to make anything funny at any time. She says the wrong (but hilarious) things, but always at the right time. Laughter is now a necessity between us, it's what keeps our friendship so strong. I think of what the human race would be like if laughter was not a factor in everyday life. Everyone knows that it wasn't a good day if you haven't laughed or let alone smiled. People would be dull, and just unhappy. Laughter heals people from sickness, it gives us the feeling that maybe everything is going to be okay after all. I truly believe that it's healthy for you. With a flip of a switch, laughing can bring within us an ecstatic, and serendipitous feeling. People take it for granted and use it for wrong when it's meant to spread the word of happiness. We're lucky to have a gift of such natural joy. Can anyone even explain, in detail, the feeling laughter truly brings us? I think not. It's like describing the scent of something. You just can't do it. The words aren't there. I think of those poor and miserable people that have forgotten what it feels like to laugh, and it's very sad. I strive to laugh every single day, and make at least one other person laugh. What is a life without a diamond in the rough like laughter? It's no life at all, for laughter will always be your shelter on the pursuit of happiness."	41
20733	" People always say laughter is a big part in a relationship. Is it true? In my opinion I am not so sure, but my grandmother says laughter is always a huge part in a relationship. Makes a you feel good when you make your best friend, parents, boyfriend or girlfriend laugh. It is the best feeling ever because you know how to put a smile on that person. Have you ever been walking around a store and you spot two couples laughing , having fun? I have and sometimes i feel like being in that same place. My grandmother always tells me her stories about her and my grandpa when they were young. She always says ""laughter plays a big part in our relationship"".  She was @NUM1 and @CAPS1 was @NUM2 the first time they met. Everyone always said they were never going to last, but the only way they could find out is to wait and believe. She felt like singing everytime she heard his name. She said she would walk into their shadows with him. She felt like all her problems would go away, everytime she had the chance to hang out with him. Everytime she could think about him she would smile and laugh. Thats how happy she felt about him. Can we call it love? I say it was, sometimes I wish I was in love like my grandmother is. She seems so happy everytime she talks about him, but i still dont know if laughter is @CAPS2 kept them together for so long. I see a really huge smile on my grandmother everytime she says, ""@CAPS1 didn't have the brightest head in the world, but @CAPS1 always knew how put a smile on my face"". Because she says that @CAPS1 wasn't so smart but @CAPS1 knew how to make jokes, and make her laugh. A question she asked me once ""@CAPS2 do you think of two couples when you see them laughing, having a good time"". The first thing that pops to your head is that they know how to have fun and doesnt let anything get in their ways of laughing and having a goodtimes. My grandmother says that the thing that kept her and my grandpa together was laughter, because if you dont know howe to make the other person laugh you dont know if you could have a good time with that person. When my grandparents are mad at each other it never last to long because my gandpa always knows how to make her laugh. Maybe if they didn't know how to make each other laugh than maybe they wouldnt be together still. I understand now my grandmother felt in love with my grandpa, because of how @CAPS1 made her laugh. In a relationship you always have to know how to put a smile on the other person, because if you dont know than pretty sure things will not work out. My grandmother was right, laughter does play a big part in their relationship.They alwasy know how to make everything better by making jokes or by doing something funny. I can never be mad at my grandparents because they know so many tricks to make my self laugh. That's @CAPS2 makes our family relationship stick together, and other familys also.I finally get it laughter is a big part in a relationship."	36
20739	" Laughter is a big part in my relationship. I feel so much more connected with a person if we laugh together. Laughing make's you feel great. You could be in a depression stage and either a friend or a family member could walk up to you and pacify you and make you laugh. If I had a relationship that had no laughter in it, I would leave that person as fast as I could. Some people think relationships are only about money and/or looks.People now and days don't last that long in a relationship. Back in the old days people would die together, and even in death they would have there graves right by each other. My boyfriends name is @PERSON1. We have been going out for four years now. He is a very funny, I love his jokes. Sometimes he doesn't even try to make a joke, but he does anyway. When we where first going out, I was throwing a birthday party and me, @PERSON1 and one of his friends went in the woods and hid from everyone else. When the others came to find us we jumped out and scared them. They where mad at us, but when night fall came we where all laughing about it together. My mom and dad don't really laugh together that much. They just go to @ORGANIZATION1 with each other and come home together. My dad loves to crack jokes now and then, but my mom is the kind of person who likes to laugh at the other people that gets hurt. My grandma is so funny. She try's to make people laugh and hurt them selves so she can get a kick out of it. All of my friends are funny. My best friend @LOCATION1 is the funniest girl I have ever known. She likes to dance funny and mock people that she doesn't like. When she works, she'll try to find something to make a joke out of, so she could bring it to me and almost make me pee my pants. @LOCATION1's relationship was very bad. She loves to laugh but her boyfriend hates making jokes. She tried to stick it out but things got worse and worse. The only thing he would do is sit on his bed or his couch and play video games, or watch wrestling. He would make @LOCATION1 clean his room and do the dishes. He has a one year old sister and he makes her watch her,clean her, and feed her while he was up in hie room playing video games. @LOCATION1 got so tired of it , so she packed her stuff and she left. She went to her sisters house. Now she has a funny boyfriend and they always laugh together. There can be a laughing relationship with animals as well as humans.Animals are the one thing that cant talk back or make fun of you. Animals are just like humans, but they cant talk and they have fur. My cat is the king of my house. His name is @CAPS1. He loves to follow me all over my house. I love to sit on the floor and watch him wrestle with all of the other cats.Every time I go into the kitchen he is always there with me, bagging for food. After he eats, he gets an erg of energy and runs all over the house. It makes me laugh. He will stop right in front of me and just stare at me, if I move then he will run away. Cats are cute but not all of them have the power to look into your soul like my cat. @CAPS1 has big eyes and his meow is so sweet and incessant. The funniest thing about him is how fat he is. He is a fat cat, but he is only one years old. So when I see him running all over the place it makes me laugh. My horse is the same way. His name is @CAPS2, and he is four years old. He is a crazy horse, but at the same time he is very funny. He try's to play with my other horses and get hurt because he bites them, so they kick him back. He has a blue eye, so I bought him for my purposes. Some people thinks horses are just a bill, but I think they are my family."	30
20746	" In many relationships I have had, there has always been laughter, love, sadness, anger and complacations. Allthough there has been one person I had a relationship with that did not involve laughter and it was reather boring and sad. I would spend troumendous hours of my time to just get one little giggle or sound of laughter out of him. He was a rather gental soul and could never harm a fly, but still could not laugh eventhough he was happy. I would ask many times over and over ""are you sure your happy because you dont seem like it? I never see you smiling or laughing all I see is a frown"" I told him with a sour face and he replyed back ""yes, @CAPS1 I am happy but just becuase I don't laugh doesn't mean I am not and besides with that silly grin on your face, how could I not be happy?"" with that reply I simply just shrugged and began again. ""then why cant you not laugh?"" and he replyed back in a drowsy voice because he was gettig tired of the same topic everyday. ""its not that I can't laugh its that I choose not to"" and I said ""well why on earth would you do that?"" he sighed and huffed really getting tired of the topic. ""allright if you don't stop this"" he said in a gental but strained voice, ""im going to have to stop being so nice to you and I just might not talk to you for the rest of the year"" but of course he was only joking, he could never not be nice to me and besides he was my bestfriend he couldn't not talk to me. The topic was dropped and never brought up again until the @DATE1 I saw him. It was a cold @DATE2 when I walked out of my house one morning to go to school. I saw a big moving rental truck outside of his house and instandtly knew that he had not lied to me but rather did not tell me that he was moving away. I began to think that it was because of me always asking him why he would not laugh but that would be a silly reason to leave. I went over to his house not caring if I was late or never did show up for school that @DATE2, I had to figure out why he was leaving. Once I got to the porch of his house he was walking to the door and I blocked the door way so that he could not go any further making sure that if he wanted to get the box of clothes to the truck that he would have to answer me. I asked him and he said, ""my father got a promotion at work and now we have to move to new york"". I begain to cry as he told me this, I was young about eight years of age and he was twellve. I knew I was not going to get to see him again so I made sure that before I lefted to school that we would hang out before he lefted. That night at the park he told me willingly without me asking him. ""@CAPS1, I know you have always wondered why I dont luagh"" he said and went on ""like I said its not that I cant laugh its that I dont want to...I just...when I was young I was teased because of my smile"". I didnt understand, why would anyone tease him? so I asked ""why though? why would someone tease you, your nice"" and he repled ""because before my new teeth grew in my old ones didn't look so great"". And once again I was still puzzled his teeth looked good to me so I asked again ""then why don't you smile now your teeth look fine to me"" he said ""I would but I don't know after being teased for so many years I just didn't feel the need to and now well...I could smile and truth be told I want to"" I said ""really!?"" with too much excitment. ""yes, and the only reason is you, your about the only person that makes me want to smile, its because of that grin you always have your always so happy. I just couldnt admit it to myself well becasue your a girl and to me I guess having a girl make me want to amile and being my only friend that is younger than me makes me feel a little weak."" I didnt understand this at the time but now that I am older I do and I am so glad that I had that one night to see his smile and many phone calls to hear his laughter. I once heard that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and quite frankly it is absoultyl true becuase after that night our friendship grew even further with just a phone call a @DATE2 and a little laughter."	33
20755	" ""Laughter is the key to the soul."" @CAPS1 you are having the worst day of your life, or the best day of your life, laughing can always make it better. I was sitting in @CAPS2 class one day, and was bored out of my mind. Then, a shy, quiet kid, all of a sudden started laughing! @CAPS3 couldn't stop! It was like @CAPS3 was on ""laughing gas."" @CAPS3 laughed so hard @CAPS3 couldn't breathe. Now this made me laugh, and then my best friend sitting next to me laugh. Soon enough the entire class was laughing! So even though some of the people in @CAPS2 class might have been bored, or had a bad day, the laughter was spread throughout the room, making it a better day. Laughter spreads like wildfire, and it makes everyone happier. And when you are happier, you are healthier. So with that, a @CAPS2 relationship must have laughter in it, in order to work. When you ask someone what they like about there boyfriend or girlfriend, if it is a @CAPS2 relationship, they will almost always say, ""@CAPS3/she makes me laugh."" @CAPS5 when you don't have laughter in a relationship, you end up in more fights, more disagreements, and more disappointment. The more you laugh the more you can live a better life and enjoy life more. Have you laughed today?"	30
20760	" Fourth period, freshman year was the highlight of my entire freshman year. @LOCATION1 was what most people called him, but I simply called him, @CAPS1. So I'll start off with the first semester of ninth grade with physical science, fourth period. I had the first term with my best friend, @PERSON1, @CAPS12 we got to choose our seats, so we sat next to each other in the back, right hand corner of the classroom. We sat there so we could get away with more, like passing notes @CAPS12 talking during class. So one day, while we were passing the notebook of notes, I most have written something that embarrassed her. So I went to grab something out of my backpack, @CAPS12 she took advantage of the situation. So next thing I knew, I was being shoved out of my desk, onto my backpack, on my back. The class got quiet, for he was giving us notes @CAPS12 showing us how to do the assignment. So as we erupted into fits o laughter, I looked at him to see if he was very angry @CAPS12 if he was going to send us outside of the classroom to talk to us. But all @CAPS1 did was look at us, shake his head, laugh a little to himself, @CAPS12 begin talking again. So, we kept laughing, but we were trying to settle down @CAPS12 stop ourselves from laughing. In the second term, @PERSON1 was @CAPS10 in there with me, but I had my friend @CAPS3-@CAPS4, @CAPS5.@CAPS5, @CAPS12 @PERSON2. i was even closer to @CAPS1 then in the first term. So, one day he was teaching us about compounds. So while he was writing down a chart to help us study, he sang out, ""@CAPS7 play the @CAPS8 @CAPS9!"" @CAPS10 even seconds later, the class burst with laughter, even he had to stop from writing he was laughing so hard. It took us about ten minutes to settle down @CAPS12 stop laughing. Another part of the second term that was a fun @CAPS12 a good laugh was doing some example problems on our own. So one of my classmates, @LOCATION2, asked what should we do to tell him we are finished with the problems. So @LOCATION1 thought for a few moments, @CAPS12 said, ""@CAPS11 you finish your problems, cluck like a chicken for me."" @CAPS12 about five minutes afterwords, people started clucking like chickens. @CAPS12 with that, my friends brought up the fact that I own chickens. But as more people were finishing their problems, it was getting annoying. It was hilarious at first though. Then there was @CAPS13 @CAPS14. We had just a regular classroom, @CAPS10 a science @CAPS13, so we were unable to do to many experiments. So @CAPS15, the other science teacher let us borrow her classroom for an entire school @CAPS14, being as her class had an online report to do. @CAPS1 banned me from using the matches, because his nickname for me was @CAPS16-@CAPS17. Then on the final day, he broke about @NUM1 to a dozen glass test tubes. @CAPS11 this happened, i was almost complete with my packet we had to do for the @CAPS14. So I went over to him while he was cleaning up, @CAPS12 I asked what happened. He told me, my classmate broke a bunch of glass test tubes by dropping them. But he looked at me @CAPS11 he did so. So @CAPS11 I looked at him, he started laughing. Which gave his cover away, so i got after him @CAPS12 told him @CAPS10 to blame the children for things he did. especially for breaking the test tubes. There was also the one time I went into his @CAPS18 class to do some homework. My friend wanted me to be there for one day, because she lvoed the class so much. So my guitar lessons teacher allowed me to spend fifth period in that class. So, @CAPS11 he was done giving notes @CAPS12 giving the class their assignment for the day. Some friends of @CAPS3 @CAPS19 called him over for a question. So I looked up from my drawing. By then he was already over to them. So they asked him if he was a swimmer, he replied he did swim. So then they asked if he shaved his legs because he was a swimmer. I think he got embaressed, so he said to come after class @CAPS12 ask personal questions. So they just wanted a yes or no, so he explained, for about five minutes, that they shouldn't waste classtime for silly @CAPS12 personal question about him. I thought the entire time, ""@CAPS20 doesn't he just say yes or no?"" @CAPS21 were fun times that I will never forget @CAPS12 tell the day I die. No class, or science class will ever replace fourth period physical science. Nor any teacher replace @LOCATION1, he is @CAPS12 always will be my favorite teacher. I will forever remember the days of every phsycial science class, because of that one simple teacher."	30
20765	" @CAPS9 you ever been scared so much that you couldn't sleep the whole night? Were you with a group of @NUM1 friends at the time? Telling scary stories can be fun and games until someone gets too afraid and freaks everyone out. It starts out with everyone watching movies and having fun until the parents go up stairs and its time to party. It was called our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" night, we call it ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" because, us @CAPS5 kids, we consider ourselves as @CAPS1. Our night involves @NUM2 antsy @LOCATION1, @NUM1 frightened teenagers, and a house that has said to be ""@CAPS6"".  To start this amazing night of terror, the guests had to arrive at first. Everyone reached at my house around @NUM4 pm. We started out by playing videos games, laughing, having a good time, eating, playing board games. Just your average teenage party. That was, until the parents went upstairs to go to bed. Once they were settled in bed and fast asleep, we brought out the ""@CAPS7 or @CAPS8"" games. I bet you thought we were gonna be immature seedlings and play the unrated version didn't you? Well, fortunately we are the @CAPS5 kids. Just your normal ""I @CAPS8 you to run around the house three times"" or ""@CAPS9 you ever kissed someone?"". Nothing unrated about that. After a while everyone just got bored of playing that redundant game, so we moved on to the next activity we were going to do which was to play sing-star on the @NUM5, but @LOCATION3 brought the wrong cords over so we couldn't hook the console up. Since that didn't turn out as planned, we started to chat and capture pictures of the @CAPS1. Since this was our ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"", it was definitely necessary to take some pictures of all of us together as a @CAPS1. For our @CAPS1 role, it goes like this, I am the father, @PERSON3 is the mother, @LOCATION3 is the cat, @PERSON8 is the @CAPS12, @PERSON9, @PERSON5, @CAPS13 and @PERSON6 were my children, @PERSON1 is my brother, @PERSON7 is the strange atrocious woman, @PERSON4 is the sister in-law, and @LOCATION2 is our cable guy. This is how we all considered each other in the @CAPS1, so we all had to wear costumes that fit our personality traits for the photos. It took a while for everyone to concentrate and to stop bickering to each other, but we managed to cooperate and proceed with the photo shoot. After photos, it was time to fulfill our appetites. I ordered pizza ahead of time before my parents went to bed. We got @NUM6 different large pizzas. Hawaiian, @CAPS14 @CAPS15, @CAPS16 @CAPS17, @CAPS18, @CAPS19 @PERSON2, and @CAPS20. One by one, we all kept coming back for more. My ""daughter"" (@CAPS13) dropped her pizza onto the carpet and left a hulking red stain. We all started to pother. @PERSON9 got the cleaner, I got the rags, @PERSON4 got the @CAPS22, and @PERSON7 got the camera. She thought it would be humorous to take pictures while we scrubbed for our life. After the mess was cleaned up, we stopped eating and placed everything else away. Now it was @CAPS23 movie time. Snuggled up onto the couch with @NUM1 people all clutched together is the ""right"" way to contemplate a @CAPS23 movie. The movie we chose was called The @CAPS24. Every one sitting on top of every one was fun until someone had to use the bathroom. Then, that's when it all happened... when @PERSON4 got up to use the bathroom, the @CAPS25 turned off, all the lights in the house shut down and we kept noticing shadows whisking across our living room walls. @CAPS13 started to cry, @LOCATION2 was complaining, @PERSON4 wouldn't go to the bathroom, and I was freaking out. Since none of the lights would turn back on, we all got in a circle on the carpet and started telling legitimately scary stories. Most of them were genuinely honest, and the others were said to be myths. There was one story that @PERSON6 portrayed about a possessed @CAPS26 that had no left leg and would go around terrorizing pedestrians. Well, it just so happened that I had a @LOCATION1 that had no left leg and when we started telling that story my @LOCATION1 started to freak out and assail all of my guests. So I grabbed my dog whistle and commanded them to cease, and dismiss. After all of the commotion, my parents never woke up and we all scurried up to my room to continue our discussion of @CAPS23 stories. During the whole process of the @CAPS2, the main lesson was that you can conquer any kind of fear as long as you @CAPS9 a sense of laughter and friends to back you up with it and that's what happened at the party. We were just hysterical about the whole situation and nobody ever left someone alone by themselves and always comforted them with laughter. By far I would @CAPS9 to say that was my favorite and most adequately funniest parties I @CAPS9 ever had."	40
20770	" Laughter is indeed an important part of anyone's day. For whatever reason, humans like to laugh, and they like to make others laugh as well. But that reminds me of a funny story... There was this time that I had to take a writing test. In fact, the test was very much like this one. In fact, it was this one. I had to write about one of four topics. Unfortunately, all four of them were about as vague as they could possibly be, and this made picking one rather challenging. After staring at the screen for a good fifteen minutes or so, I began to silently laugh at my situation: I have to write about one of four things when not a single one was even remotely interesting. For some reason, I found my problematic situation amusing, as I am kind of weird that way. But then it hit me... one of the four topics was about laughter... why not write about myself laughing at the irony of my situation? Yes, all I had to do was tell a true story about a time I laughed, so I used this delightful vagueness to my advantage. The topic did not state that the laugh had to be an actually audible one, nor did it state what kind of laugh it had to be, so I figured a silent laugh at irony would do just as well as an audible laugh at something silly.  So now I had my topic. To make things even more amusing, as I wrote about myself laughing at the fact that I had to write about myself laughing, I began to laugh at how silly the task I was carrying out was. However, I began to worry that whoever is grading these things @MONTH1 not find this as amusing as I did, which would perhaps hurt my grade. But that possibility served only to make the situation even more ironic, and consequently amusing.  You @MONTH1 think that I am easily amused, but to that I must say: well, yeah, I kind of am. I can find almost anything amusing, but that, I find, is the beauty of laughter. It is so abstract, that each and every person experiences it in differently. Some people @MONTH1 find very simple things considerably amusing, but others @MONTH1 be not so easily amused. These differences are part of why interacting with other people is so enjoyable. As I said before, humans like to laugh, and we like to make other people laugh with us. And regardless of the way you @MONTH1 interpret laughter's abstract form, you've got to admit: it's kind of funny."	39
20775	" One time when i was spending the night at @ORGANIZATION1's she wanted to sleep oustide in a tent. @CAPS2 was @DATE1 and we always tryed seeing eachother anytime possible because she had to go back to boarding school alot. So her mom set up the tent for us on the deck, and after we ate dinner, we grabbed our things and went ouside. She was on the phone with her boyfriend and i was on the phone with mine, and both of them were best friends. @CAPS2 was like two best friends dating two bestfriends, and we were closer then ever. My boyfriend had to get off the phone because he had work in the @TIME1 so @CAPS2 was just @LOCATION1 on the phone. I started saying really funny things and she just started laughing so hard that she snorted and at the time she was still on the phone with her boyfriend. At this point i was just cracking up with laughfter, @ORGANIZATION1 started laughing even harder because she saw me laughing and pee'd her self while she was on the phone with her boyfriend. For some reason she forgot that she was on the phone with him and started laughing even more after that happend, so all of this was going on at around one in the @TIME1 and i was surprised her mom didn't come out and yell at us for being loud. When i looked over and saw that she had pee'd her self i yelled out ""@CAPS1 my god, @CAPS3 pee'd your self @ORGANIZATION1!"" @CAPS2 was the most funniest thing, i dont think i have ever laughed so hard in my entire life. So her boyfriend finally got her attention and said ""@CAPS3 should probably go take care of that,"" and then they got off the phone. She was really embarassed after that, i mean i would be too if that happend to me."	33
20781	" The laughter in me.  To me all you need to do to get through a tough and horrible day is a good @CAPS5. It gives you hope throughout the day, and no matter what kind of mood your in, when leaving to work, going to school, or really any activity that involves a ""sigh"" moment. For me I get that feeling about school, but I can always count on my best friend, @PERSON1. Everyday she manages to say something totally off topic and we'd end up dying of laughter at the top of the stairs near the science labs were we eat lunch. As people walk by they give us weird looks, we don't care because we understand each other. To me @CAPS9 is my way of reliving stress.My @CAPS1 agrees with me her name is @CAPS2 I call her @ORGANIZATION1. We've been best friends since the second grade. She is my rock. She inspires me to do something with my life, something more than working at some fast food restaurant. I hang out a lot at her at her house and we share so many great and fun memories. Its really bad when we are around each other, its like one look at each other and boom!, I'm on the floor not breathing because I'm dying of laughter. I don't know what it is but, its like when we see each other its a rush off all the good times we've spent coming together all at once. Sometimes we @CAPS5 hysterically over nothing. I doesn't make sense but I guess that doesn't matter when your hanging with your best bud.  Laughter is an important part of my relationship with anyone. Its shows me how fun a person can be and if the have a sense of humor. It shows me that they can smile and not some stuck up want to be perfect robot. All @PERSON1 and I talk about is boys and boy problems and it makes me @CAPS5 and giggle, but when we are in our fifth period class forestry and fire we are like caged monkeys in a zoo. It's like we are magically ""high,"" all of a sudden have this out burst of energy. We sit next to sit side by side to one another and we tickle each other and @CAPS5 really loud. By the end of class I make a paper ball and we play paper soccer ball its fun especially when the teacher gives you dirty looks and tells you to stop and you don't do it. Lets just say that her face turns a very bright red color.Nothing compares to how much I @CAPS5 when I'm with @ORGANIZATION1. When I used to go to @CAPS3 I had three classes with her @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, and @CAPS4. We also had lunch together, but anyway as I was saying, I swear we had a not stop @CAPS9 war everyday. My @CAPS5 is more like a cackle mixed with giggling. Some people like, some thinks its cute, others think I @CAPS5 funny( The weird kind of funny). In @ORGANIZATION2 she'd stand next to me and she'd look at me weird, or said something that didn't come out right, or sang obnoxiously, anything she did cracked me up it was so distracted when she was around but so much fun. I swear I got all of my exercise from @CAPS9 with her. At home when my family is all together, are way of laughter is mostly picking on one another. It's different than laughter with your friends. We make fun of how my sister @CAPS6 was supposed to be a boy because everybody thought she was going to be a boy when she was in our mothers stomach. We made fun of my brother for being the only boy out of five kids. We make fun of my sister @PERSON2 for being the shortest one in our family. I can feel the difference between laughter. It's mostly criticism really.I @CAPS5 mostly because I feel more alive it gives me something to live for everyday in stead of ""@CAPS7 great, another day to try to get through, @CAPS8...no."" @CAPS9 for me gets me motivated for the day it's like my drug to get through life. It gives me an easy way in to communicate with others. I thank @CAPS10 for giving us the ability to @CAPS5 because without it I would lose my mind and have a hard time making friends. ""That's how I make friends I @CAPS5.""  "	40
20790	" Laughter has been a nonchalant but steady and strong force for me in many relationships. I believe that laughter is useful in getting to know people you've just met and growing closer to people you care about. In my opinion @CAPS2 brings people closer and can change a bad situation upside down. Getting enough bravery to gain new friends, ask this girl out and eventually develop a good relationship with her, is where laughter played an important role. @CAPS2 was the @DATE1 I was fifteen and a sophomore at @ORGANIZATION1 school. @CAPS2 was my first year there. I have been to many schools, @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 wood, etc. and like any new school I was having a hard time connecting on a social level with my peers. Everyday I woke up, got ready, went to school, got home did homework (maybe), and went to bed . @CAPS2 was a boring cycle that I seemed to be trapped in. The image of being cool and trying to fit in did not seem to work so much. Because one thing I realized was that trying to be cool and something you're not only gets you so far. The one thing that kids, people in general, like is when you're real and being yourself . I found that out later on, but I actually didn't realize that's what people liked the most. I said to myself one time that I didn't like trying to act like someone or something because the truth was I actually thought that I was a cool person deep down. So I changed my ways I stopped trying to act cool, and acted like myself. And @CAPS2 turned out that I actually was cool and that girls actually found me attractive, and not only attractive but a funny person that was likable. My main attribute, well besides my looks was my ability to make people laugh or at least smile. @CAPS2 gained me many friends that I didn't have in the beginning. @CAPS2 even gained me one of the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. Her name was @LOCATION2, in my eyes there was no girl that could compare to her in any way. She had the body of a coca cola bottle, caramel skin, and the face of a goddess ( and I'm not exaggerating). Like any beautiful girl she had many followers and admirers who were similar to me. So what chance did I have? What did I, @PERSON1 have to offer her? Laughter. My greatest attribute that had come to my rescue many of times. Even though @CAPS2 didn't last as long as I would have liked @CAPS2( forever) @CAPS2 was great being with her for as long as I did, the things we got to do and the many experiences we had together, are priceless. And @CAPS2 was all because of my ability to make her laugh and to put a smile on her face. I believe that without laughter this world would not be the place that @CAPS2 is today. Sure, there is still crime and many horrors and atrocity's committed today, but imagine how horrid @CAPS2 would be without laughter. Joy, which I believe is the core of what laughter brings, allows us to forgive and forget. @CAPS2 allows us to turn our heads and overlook things. Without us being able to laugh how could we expect to survive the future"	40
20795	" Its always hard to know what to do when a friend or family member comes to you when they are sad or mad. Most of the time you don't know what to do. I have learned that making people laugh with something as simple as a joke can always make them feel better. As I was sitting at home one sunny afternoon, I got a call from my friends @PERSON1. When I put the phone to my ear all I could hear was a loud crying. @PERSON1 wasn't saying anything to me, not one word. Even though, I repeatedly asked her what was wrong with her, @PERSON1 wouldn't even say a word. Not knowing what to do or say to her anymore, I asked her to calm down and take deep breaths. Desperately, I wanted her to be able to talk to me and tell me what was going on because I had started to get really worry. Couple minutes later, @PERSON1 started explaining to me what had happen. @PERSON1 started off by telling me she was irresponsible that she didn't pay attention to what was happening around her. I asked her why she was saying that about herself because I knew she was a responsible person. Finally, @PERSON1 screamed that while she was home watching the @CAPS1 basketball team play basketball, her dog @CAPS2 got run over. The dog had actually died. I found it very ridiculous and pathetic that @PERSON1 would be crying over her dog. I didn't want to be rude about it and tell her what was going threw my mind at that time. Even thought that was the way I felt about the whole situation. I thought of what the words I needed to say to @PERSON1 but I was confuse. Actually, it wasn't so much that I was confuse, I was afraid of hurting her feelings with my words. Finally, I decided to tell her not to worry about her dog, that my friend had a couple of dogs for sale. Also, I told @PERSON1 that if it made her feel any better I would buy her a new puppy. After saying that to her there was an awkward silence. My hands started to get shaky because I thought @PERSON1 was mad. All of the sudden I just heard her start laughing really loud and once again she couldn't talk. I felt so relief that I had made her laugh and not cry or get mad at me. @PERSON1 wouldn't shut her mouth she just laughed and laughed and laugh hysterically. Finally, she shut her mouth up and started talking to me again. @PERSON1 thanked me for making her laugh and making a joke out the situation. Rather than saying depressing words that would make her feel bad and make her cry even more. I was happy I made her laugh because she felt better about herself and not worst. As I was laughing I told her that anytime she needed to laugh I was the person she needed to be call. Anytime, any day and anywhere I would be happy to bring a smile to her face and a loud laugh to her mouth. @PERSON1 laughed with me and thank me one more time for making her laugh. From that day on I always like to make people laugh because I know I'm going to make them feel better. I sure love it when others make me laugh too. It's just an amazing feeling, a great feeling that everyone loves and cant really describe. After making my friend @PERSON1 laugh I found out laughter was a key element of life.   "	35
20803	"                             ""Laughter"" I once heard a man say "" laughing is the key to happiness, and if you do not laugh you aren't healthy"" @CAPS1 do people love to laugh? Because it laughing creates great memories, it gets rid of sadness, it gives you energy, and it even gives you a good abdominal work depending on how hard you laugh and for how long. There is nothing better than a good funny movie that makes you laugh so hard you cry, your jaw hurts, and your stomach is even sore the next day. Some of my favorite movies are funny.  I bet laughing or making someone else laugh could get you hired at a job. Say you go in for an interview for a job that involves you working with people everyday. Are you going to go in there boring and moditone? No, your going to go in there make the person who is interviewing you laugh and act like you have known him or her since @CAPS2 @CAPS3.  Laughter can also be abused. It can be used in bad ways, such as making fun of people because it @MONTH1 be funny. Calling kids in your gym class names because they cant throw a baseball as far as you. Laughing @MONTH1 make people feel as bright as the stars at night, or it @MONTH1 make people feel as bad as a basketball player missing the buzzer beater to win the championship game. Be careful when you use it, treat it like a loaded gun, because if you use it wrong it could hurt someone.  A few hours after my @CAPS4 died. My family and I began to talk about all the good memories we spent with her when she was with us. I had noticed that tears were rolling down the sides of my @CAPS5 @PERSON1's cheeks. We then suddenly began to talk about all the times she would get mad mad and swear at my dad when he was a little boy, then get embarrassed because she knew she never should have said the lords name in vain. After thinking back on those moments we began to laugh, and not just a small unnoticeable giggle, i mean we were laughing out loud. It then got rid of that aching sadness that had been in the room all night. I will never forget how laughter that very night would become such an emotional memories later in life."	37
20808	" Laughing makes you live longer. That's what I was told as a child. I think laughing is really important in life. And, in relationships. In my realationship with my sister @LOCATION1, we laugh all day, everyday. And I think thats why we have most fun together. I laugh most when I'm with my homies. I remember one time I was with @PERSON2 and we were just laughing so hard over nothing, thats something we do alot. I'm just a laughing person. Everybody knows that. I think when I laugh it just takes everything thats bad right now, and none of that even matters. I have this one friend namd @PERSON3, and he was the kind of person that made me laugh no matter what kind of mood I was in. So because of that, he'll always be an important person in my life. One time me and @PERSON2 were with this girl that was very quiet for some reason when she was with us, and I just straight up told her that she needs to talk, or laugh! or something. Then she opened up and actually laughed about the funny things. See, if your with a bunch of friends, or people that your affiliated with it's not good to just sit there and not say or do anything, just be yourself. Laugh about the things you think are funny even if other people dont kaugh about it. Who cares. Be you. I love, absoulutly love when babies laugh. When a baby laughs, to me it means that baby is gonna be a happy human. In movies and tv shows, sometimes I laugh. I just feel like if you laugh, your life will be way easier than just looking at the negative things. Just be happy, and laugh every once and a while.  One time me and my sister @PERSON2 stole a truck, well.. We asked the guy if we could use his truck for something and he said yeah, but we really didnt use it for anything.. We just wanted to drive. And, when we started driving, we were going so fast, and blasting loud music. It was hilarious, and now everytime we listen to that song we were blasting, we just crack up laughing. So, when you make good memories and later in life think about the memories, or they get brought up somehow.. It's funny to just sit there and reminise. I could tell you a thousand stories. Heres one. One time, me and @PERSON2 were living with our good friend @PERSON1, and we were under his table pretending we were in a space ship, it was so, so, so, much fun! I'll never forget that time. And even when I'm writing this I still laugh about these stories. One time me and my sister @PERSON2 were skating downtown, and I was trying to do this one trick, I think it was a tre' flip? Anyways, I tryed to do it and I fell on my butt. It hurt, but it was hilarious. And now everytime we pass that place where i fell, we just laugh about it. Memories are fun, every memory that I have, I laugh when remebered. One time me and @PERSON2 were hanging out with some cool people, and then we left and went to this girls house, and there we turned the music up all the way and just danced for like a hour, we have a video of it. That was really funny. In the video I'm mostly just laughing. "	31
20815	"                              Laughter                               @PERSON1   Laughter has many benefits that make us have might make us have more distance in between two people or maybe make us have differenceses in between the relationships you have with people. But many other people believe and (think) that laughter is an important part of any relationship with your friends, family ect. Now I'm going to talk about a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit to us, and how it can also make us have distances from people, or how laughter works in between relashionships we have with friends. Many people think that it's really fun to laugh about simple things and thats me I can laugh for things that might not seem funning to others, but to me they might seem extremely funny. I won't stop laughing for a while. But many other poeple don't consider laughter as funny, as many others. I believe that laughter is an important part of us because it shows people around you the way you are and how you express your self on things. Many of your friends or even your family will know what type of person you are and how silly you can get to be sometimes. Thats the reason why I think it's a great idea or (thing) to do around, just have some fun and laugh. Now talking about relashionship in between people. Do you think that laughter can be an important part of any relationship or how could it help us (ways)????? Well yes I do think that laughter can be extremely important in many relationship we have with people. You get to know and others get to know about you and how you are.  Eventhough many relationships that we have with our friends, family, or with new people we meet. I believe that laughter tells you how a person is and how that person reacts to what other people do or tell them. Laughter expresses how that person is and wheither they are fun people to be around. Laughter even tells you if that person has a lot of humor, just a little, or doesn't have any humor at all. When people don't have that much humor they really don't understand and get the funny parts from jokes or anything. I also think that laughter is really important to any type of relationship you have with anybody, because that makes you know that person a lot better. But other people consider laughter being a reason that distances two people from each other.I don't considerlaughter being a reason for to people to have distances in between. The reasons why I think and say this is becasue their are many people that laugh a lot almost crying and they don't have distances in between other people or anything. They might get more friends or more people to talk to them becasue other people as well might see how that person is and they might see that the person is really fun to be around with. I know this becasue I laugh a lot and that hasn't happened to me. Thats why I don't consider and don't believe that laughter is being the reason to have distances in between people (relationship). In my opinion I consider laughter a very important part of who we are, the way we think, and also the things we like to do. What I mean by this is that you can have some humor but you don't actually express the way you are thinking about what other do. Or if something is super silly and theirs a new kid at school and you or someone else says something you might probably think that it's funny but you might just not want to laugh at that moment becasue you @MONTH1 a little to shy or simply becasuue you might not know that person as well and maybe the other person won't have enough confidence to laugh with you for whatever silly thing someone just said. Although many people still should laugh whenever they want. Sometimes if you laugh a lot you might be the happiest and funniest person anywhere. Or whenever somebody is sad you might as well be the only person theri who can make her/him laugh and happy. In addition these were some of the reasons why i think that laughter is great for you, that way people will get to know you better. These were a few reasons of how laughter can be a benefit,how it can distance people."	31
20822	" Laughing is one of the key components in all my relationships with others. It lightens the mood of any situation and can really lift my sprits when I'm having a bad day. It is often the ice breaker when I meet someone new and can help me get closer to the friends I already have.  On the first day of school, freshman year, I met a girl named @LOCATION1. We were in writing class and there was a boy named @CAPS1 sitting between us. @CAPS1 and I were talking about our schedules, and he said something that made our conversation slightly uncomforatable. I looked up and saw that @LOCATION1 had heard what he had said and had a look on her face that was somewhere between being embarrassed for me and close to laughing. I smiled at her and mouthed the word ""awkward"" when @CAPS1 turned away. This was her cue that it was okay to laugh, and she did so subtly. I didn't know that this first laugh would lead to many more in a friendship that would develop almost instantly. After the first week of schedules being changed and students being shuffled around, we found out that we had every single one of our classes together, except @CAPS3. We probably spent more time laughing in those classes than getting work done, and I'm not exactly sure how we managed to pass all our classes. Spending so much time together, it was only a matter of time before we had enough inside jokes to fill up a dictionary. Nearly any word or just the sight of something related to one of our jokes can send us into a fit of laughter. Sometimes, we don't have to say anything at all. I'll just look at her, and we'll burst out laughing. Because of this, our friends often question our sanity. When we start laughing, they'll look at eachother, and then at us for a clue as to why, or ask if we are okay. They don't understand us the way we understand eachother. People always get our names mixed up even though we look nothing alike. Our names dont even rhyme, or start with the same letter. But I can't really blame them. We're so much alike! From the activities we participate in to the way we think, we could almost be the same person. She makes me laugh every single day, and she's one of my best friends. @CAPS4 is another one of my friends who is constantly making me crack up. Whenever I'm with her, I'm always terrified of peeing in my pants. She's not as close to me as @LOCATION1 is, but we've gotten to be such better friends this year. We have a lot of classes together this year, and that's probably why we've gotten closer. We're always doing stupid stuff together, and laughing about it the whole time. For example, she and I like to laugh obnoxiously loud and exaggerate our ""ha's"" when someone tells a really lame or cheesy joke. Our biotech teacher loves to tell cheesy jokes, so when we're in his class, we sit together anticipating one of his jokes so that we can laugh. We also like to chew our gum with our mouths open, in order to make the chewing noise louder. I often laugh so hard that I can't even chew. I know I'll have a good day if I'm with @CAPS4. She can make me laugh in a way a lot of my other friends can't. It comes deep from within, to the point where you can't even breathe, and tears and running down your face. It makes your entire face is sore, even your eyes, from being scrunched up for so long. She's such a fun person to be around, and I'm glad to have her as one of my friends. Laughing is a very important part in the relationships I have with other people. If my friends couldn't make me laugh, our friendship would be so much more boring. Nothing would be fun. If I never laughed, I'd never be happy, and that's not a life I'm willing to try. Life is hard. It's not easy, and it's not always going to be smiles and smooth sailing. There's going to be sadness and rough waters. But no matter how tough this life @MONTH1 get, I know I'll have friends like @LOCATION1 and @CAPS4 there to share a laugh."	45
20827	" I didn't believe my grandfather when @CAPS2 told me laughing could cure anything. I was nine years old, the days were dark @CAPS3 cold @CAPS3 I felt like my life was a shattered piece of a stain glass window. Not only had @PERSON2, my ageless pit bull, just died @CAPS6 also my little sister would tease me if I dared to shed a tear for the lost of my best pet. I sat on the coach, staring at the fire as it crackled @CAPS3 popped, when my grandfather sat down beside me @CAPS3 told me a story. It was about him, when @CAPS2 was young @CAPS3 how lost @CAPS1 best friend too, only @CAPS1 friend wasn't a pet. ""@CAPS1 name was @PERSON3,"" @CAPS2 began, ""@CAPS3 we were eleven years old. Oh, how we had so much fun. All we did was @CAPS7! We thought we were gonna grow old together @CAPS3 be each others best men @CAPS3 cause trouble tell the end. @CAPS2 was my best friend until the end. I loved him, very much like how you love @PERSON2. I never thought anything would happen to him. I thought that we'd both live forever. @CAPS6 then something did happened. @PERSON3, @CAPS2 had gone fishing alone because I was at church @CAPS3 @CAPS1 @CAPS4 had to work, @CAPS3 it was such a wonderful day to @CAPS11 down to the river @CAPS6 then @CAPS2 never came back from the river..."" @CAPS5 sniffled at the old story, "" @CAPS6 you see, @PERSON1, there's a cure for sadness. Do you want to know @CAPS9 it is?"" I nodded half thinking there was a magical medication or spell. ""@CAPS7."" @CAPS2 said. ""@CAPS9?!"" I was utterly shocked. ""@CAPS10, it's simply,"" @CAPS2 said gently, knowing my easy temper, ""@CAPS11 through the stages of grieving. Feel lost for a little bit, @CAPS6 then find your way back home. @CAPS7 is in your heart @CAPS3 always will be. Find a wave of joy @CAPS3 @CAPS11 with the flow. Love life, because, as you have just seen, it can be so short."" I nodded @CAPS6 didn't look at @CAPS1 sober face. @CAPS2 kissed the top of my head. @CAPS2 looked into my eyes ( I didn't dare meet the intensity of @CAPS1) @CAPS3 I knew @CAPS2 saw the reflection of the fire blazing in my watery green blue eyes @CAPS3 could see my processing @CAPS9 @CAPS2 had just told me. Then @CAPS2 left me alone to think. I needed to move on? How? Life wasn't that easy. I knew that. I opened up my note book to do some homework to get my mind off @PERSON2, @CAPS5, @CAPS3 @PERSON3. That's when I discovered a small piece of paper the size of a deck of cards. I flipped it over, showing that it was a picture. A tear leaked out of the corner of eye. It was of me @CAPS3 @PERSON2. We were both in a mud pit. My blond hair looked like dirt ( considering that I had been rolling in mud). My pit bull was rubbing @CAPS1 greasy head on my shoulder smearing more mud on to myself. I smiled, missing him even more, @CAPS6 feeling a lot better then a minute before. I loved him. I loved him so much. I still do this day, @CAPS6 I had to get over that my friend was gone. After I saw the picture, I had laughed to myself, automatically feeling better about being such a horrid granddaughter @CAPS3 a inconsiderate best friend. @CAPS6 seeing the good times we had, @CAPS3 smiling, made me honestly feel better about myself. Huh? Maybe laughter is the cure for anything."	45
20832	" Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. Many times there are things that happen that make you laugh. For example; someone trips over your backpack and @CAPS7 fall @CAPS3 their face. You can't help it but laugh! Then you start feeling bad and wish you wouldn't of laughed at them for tripping, but then you start remembering how @CAPS7 fell and you think about it and you end up laughing so hard that you can't stop until you get in trouble. Laughter is a big part of your life that their isn't at least a time of day that you don't laugh. Everybody in my family is fun and @CAPS7 always make me laugh. Their isn't a time when we are quiet and one of us has to say ""awkward silence."" We are always laughing and having fun and we are never sad. Let me tell you about the one time my family was laughing when we went back in time to remember those times that we now call ""good times."" I will tell you how laughter is a big part in my family. And how embarrassment is involved. It is a beautiful sunny day @CAPS3 @DATE1. Today was a big day for me, @ORGANIZATION2. It was the day I was going to have my @CAPS1 party. I woke up, took a shower, went to my mom's @ORGANIZATION1 and sat down @CAPS3 a chair to have my hair done. I was wearing my @PERSON1 pajamas with a black shirt that said ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3."" I got my hair done, did my make-up, put my dress @CAPS3, went outside to take pictures, and got @CAPS3 the limousine so I could go to church. After I went to church I took pictures with my family and then went to @CAPS4 to take pictures at the @ORGANIZATION3 building. After we got back from @CAPS4, I went to the @ORGANIZATION1, at @CAPS6, and got ready for my waltz. I did my first waltz with my court of honor; six guys and six girls and my partner. After the waltz I danced the second waltz with my dad. When I was done dancing with my dad, I got ready for the surprise dance. I started dancing with my court of honor and my partner and towards the end came the big part... I was supposed to be picked up by my girls and the guys were supposed to spell my name @CAPS7 ran in front of me and the girls when one of the guys, who is my uncle, ran to the right instead of the left and spelled my name wrong! The guys were supposed to spell ""@ORGANIZATION2"", with two guys wearing black @CAPS3 each end, but @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS8""! One of the other guys saw the mistake right away, so he moved to the left and since my uncle didn't move to the left either, @CAPS7 ended up spelling ""@CAPS9""! I'm am not going to lie...I saw my uncle when he was in the wrong spot because the letters were facing my way, but I could of stopped that from happening but I didn't because I couldn't! But at the end it was funny. Everybody in there started laughing and I got so embarrassed! But when I was walking off the dance floor I started laughing! Now that we think about it, that is the funniest thing that has ever happened in our family. I guess laughter really is there when something embarrassing happens. Laughter is something that is there when you are happy. Laughter is there when we are having fun and when we are in a good mood, it makes us smile. But laughter is always there when we have an embarrassing moment. Laughter is always with us. It doesn't matter if we mean to or not, but we end up doing something dumb that makes us laugh. Laughter is always with me when I'm with my family. Laughter is with me because my family is fun, crazy, and cool. No matter how sad we are, it doesn't matte if we are sad because one of my family members were in a car accident or someone died, we remember the times when we were happy and when we were having fun with that person. We end up remembering the fun we had together, that we start laughing really hard! Laughter is there when we are happy, but it is also there when it is the best day of your life. Laughter is a moment of happiness."	36
20839	One day me and my friend taylor got the idea on a snow day to get his quad and tie a rope to the back he was drifting around a post he didnt see the hill and i was on the back on a slead and i flew over the quad and got about @NUM1 feet high then crashed it hurt but it was so funny we both couldnt stop laughing for ten min.then we went back to his creek it was frozen about @NUM2 inch thick then i was drven the quad and he was in the back i was driving along the bank and he was on the ice then it started to crack so i went faster so he didnt fall in then after about two min the ice cracked and he went under then i got him out and i drove as fast as the quad could go and got back to his house he changed and then he just sat there and laughted for hours about what we both did.	24
20846	" Laughter is a symbol of joy and happiness. It is to become amused or derisive. Many people today make jokes or funny remarks just to hear somebody laugh. It is never something we should take for granted. Through many relationships no matter what kind, I believe laughter takes up at least @PERCENT1 of your relationship. It's to show the best out of someone and to let them know you are listening. There are plenty of other reasons in this world needed for laughter. ""I'm sure you can even think of one"".  In my views of this world and our society today, I believe laughter is what makes up our ""human"" spirit. It's to show ourselves and other people the spark we have inside us. Have you ever sat and pondered why we make each other laugh? I have asked myself this same question over and over. For me making people laugh is letting them know I care and to also think I'm funny as well. We even do it just the fact of wanting people to like us better and to be known as funny, hilarious, or just a good person to talk to. Sometimes we can go to the extremes of being to funny, and feeling guilty for picking on someone in a laughable way.  I remember in the eighth grade, I was thirteen years old. I was really shy and didn't have much friends. One day in class some of the popular kids actually came over and started talking to me. I was @CAPS1 excited and nervous that other kids wanted to talk to me. Of course they were laughing and making jokes, not caring what anyone else was saying. Then this one girl started talking about other people like she knew everything. When she started talking about my best friend it made me angry but happy at the same time, because some of the things she was saying were true. That's were I messed up, I started talking about all the other dumb things she did, just to make everybody else laugh. As I was sitting there all I felt was guilt and disappointment in myself. I couldn't believe I was sitting there talking about my best friend, just to try and make myself popular. Later that day she came up to me really upset and couldn't understand why I would do that to her. I told her I was sorry and that I only did it to make myself popular and seem funny to other kids. We didn't talk for almost two weeks. @CAPS1 I tried to do everything in my own possible way to get my best friend back. It did take me awhile, but she finally came around and forgave me. It was a good life lesson for me, knowing laughter @MONTH1 not always be a good thing. Now me and my friend are juniors in high school and when we think back on that day. We both together can share a laugh. In conclusion, you can see how laughter can bring somebody up and tear them down. I have experienced these things as well in my life time. Laughter has made me stronger and to be a better person, even if it means turning down popular kids @CAPS1 you don't hurt those closest to you.""@CAPS1 go out and make somebody laugh today""."	34
20851	"A true story for me in laughter. My favorite memory in laughter happened two years ago @CAPS4 I meet my friend @CAPS1. I meet her at the @ORGANIZATION1. I was walking out of @ORGANIZATION5's @CAPS4, @CAPS1 was walking in. We bumped right into each other. First, we were both mad at each other and just saying, ""@CAPS3 watch where your going!"" @CAPS4 we both calmed down we went our separate ways. I went to the food court and not even ten minutes behind me she was right there. We both waited in the @ORGANIZATION3 line. @CAPS1 and I just stood by each other for awhile, until I apologized for running into her earlier. She said, ""@CAPS5 its @CAPS6, I should of been watching where I was going other then watching the floor, as I walk."" We laughed for a little while until it was our turn to get some food. After we payed, I asked her if she would like to sit with me because we were both alone at the time. The reason why we were alone was because both of our parents were doing more shopping. We started to talk about where we were from and what schools we go to. @CAPS1 goes to a private @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1 in @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION6. I have told her I went to @ORGANIZATION2. We were both in our freshmen year of @ORGANIZATION4 @ORGANIZATION2 and we both loved band. @CAPS1 and I have just noticed that we have meet before once at a band competition. We have bumped into each other before the same way at least a year ago before bumping into each other again. As she was coming out of one of the rooms where her band was warming up. I was just coming across the room to get to the room where my band was warming up in two doors down. I was just walking, just like @CAPS1 was just walking in the @ORGANIZATION1, I was watching the floor as I walked. Also, we both got mad each other as well. We both just laughed for awhile just laughing how we did the same thing, but the other way to each other before. We both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends. I guess having laughter with someone you can tell if you well be good friends or not. Laughter is a big deal in friendship. I mean whats the point of having a friend @CAPS4 you don't even have laughter once in awhile and have awesome memories with each other. I still hang out with @CAPS1 until this very day and we still can't believe that we meet twice in the same way."	32
20859	" ""@CAPS1 ma, do you know where my purse is."" I wonder where it is, I need to put my license in my wallet. I kept looking around and found it in my room under all my dirty clothes. A sigh of relief came over me, I was glad I found it before something happened. I woke up @DATE1 @TIME1 and figured it would be just another day. I had plans to go to a basketball game after school. It was the biggest game of the season, we were playing our rivals, the @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The day was going by slow though, I couldn't wait until it was over. Finally the bell rang, school was over, I drove home a little disappointed. I wasn't sure if my friends were going to the game with me, if they didn't go I probably wouldn't either. I was determined though, I texted them at five and convinced them it would be fun. I picked up my friend @PERSON1 first, then @PERSON2.  This is when my normal day turned into one of the most eventful days ever. The @ORGANIZATION1 (where the game was being held) was about twenty minutes away, I had to stop and get gas before we left. We went to the cheapest spot in town and filled up my car. When it was time to leave, my car decided not to start. I have an old car and it doesn't start all the time, it just sits there for a while until it wants to start. There were some guys in the other lane that we new staring at us. We just started laughing it was really embarrassing. The attendant asked us if we needed something else and I said no, my car just wasn't starting. I tried turning it on again, but it just kept dieing. Out of all the other days my car decided not to start, today. Then some men came out and told me that they had to move my car I got so embarrassed and starting laughing again. I always laugh when I get nervous. I told them to let me try turning on my car once more, I prayed my car would turn on this time. It did, I was so relieved and embarrassed, I left as soon as I could.  Twenty minutes later we were in @ORGANIZATION1 in front of the school, and just my luck again, no parking spots. We drove around for about five minutes until we found one that was walking distance. Then we gathered our things and walked to the game. It hadn't started yet but it was about to, I had a feeling it would be a really close game. Soon the game began and just how I figured, the game kept going back and forth, we got a point, they got a point. It was really exciting but there where two parents behind us that were really into the game. They kept shouting at players, shouting at the referee, and just being annoying. The game was good, but in the end The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 won by @CAPS6 points. It was a little disappointing, but The @ORGANIZATION1 did have a good team.   After the game we were going to eat at @ORGANIZATION2. We left the game quickly after it was over so we wouldn't get stuck in traffic. I was driving down this road I thought I new but then I realized I didn't recognize it at all. @PERSON2 told me to keep going she new where we were. I stayed on the road and luckily it took us straight to down town by @CAPS7. I got onto one of the main roads and headed to @ORGANIZATION2. The road I was on had a million stop lights though, and I was stopping every @NUM1 minutes. Then a pedestrian decided to cross the street in front of me, I waited for him to cross even though he wasn't even on a crosswalk. I kept going no worries on my mind, music blasting, when suddenly rainbow lights behind me. This day couldn't get any worse, I pulled over and waited for the @CAPS8 to come up to my window. He asked for my license and registration. I got my purse and looked in my wallet. My heart pounded where was my license i had just put it in my purse a few days ago. I started to panic and laughter filled the air. My nerves got to me I couldn't help it. I looked everywhere finally he asked if I had my school I.D, I went to pull it out and there was my license right underneath. He went back to his car, leaving me bursting with laughter. He came back and told me my insurance was expired, another thing that added to my day. I was still laughing when he gave me my ticket for speeding and expired insurance. I think I got it because I was laughing and he thought I was taking it as a joke. You cant control nerves though, or at least I can't."	43
20865	" It was some day in @DATE1, I was on my way to school. My friend @PERSON1 was walking with me because we both lived on the same street. He lived a few houses away from me but we always walked to and from school together. Well on this particular day i decided to wear a pair of sneakers that had absolutely no traction on the bottom of the shoe and there was snow out. I slipped a few times but never fell. We were laughing because I would be right in the middle of saying something and id almost fall over. We got to school and he started telling everyone about it, I joined in. It was pretty funny because even at school I would almost fall over because the floors were wet from the dried snow. I thought about just walking home and changing my shoes but I would have to wait until lunch because I couldn't leave school until then or i would get in trouble. After first period I found a puddle of water and started sliding across it for fun. My friends tried doing it too but their shoes had too much traction on it. The bell rang for second period to start and I headed to my class. It was fun trying to get to class because I slid around everywhere. Once I got into class the teacher told me we where going on a field trip to the ponds. I was about to skip out on it but the teacher was walking right behind me. We boarded the bus and started heading out to the ponds. My teacher called our names out to make sure we were all there. He must have done it about every @NUM1 minutes. It was pretty annoying. The bus driver was playing country music too, I don't really mind country music but that day I didn't really want to listen to it. I went to get my ipod from my pocket and found out it wasn't there. I had left it at my house when I was rushing to get to school.  We finally arrived at the ponds and we unloaded the bus to begin our field trip. Our teacher told us not to go to close to the ponds because if we fell in we would be soaked and the bus driver wouldn't let us back on the bus. I thought he was just talking smack and I asked the bus driver if he was serious. The bus driver told me if we got wet he would have to wait for us to dry off so we didn't get the seats wet. Again I thought it was a bunch of bull. We met up with our tour guide dude and started listening to him tell us about the history of the ponds and what they are used for. While walking around the ponds I started to slide on the ground. I grabbed onto my friend so I wouldn't fall over but he had pretty bad balance and we both fell over. Everyone started laughing as well as myself. My friend didn't think it was too funny at first. But once he got up he started laughing and joked about how I couldn't stand up right. On our way back to the school we talked about what we learned and if we would want to go back and learn more or even volunteer to work at the ponds. I thought it would be pretty fun if I didn't slip around the whole time. We unloaded the bus again and headed into the school. I found out the little puddle i had found earlier hadn't dried up, I got a running start and slid across it. I didn't fall over this time. The bus had brought us back just in time for the last class of the day, which unfortunately for me was @CAPS1. I got to the gym and asked my teacher what we were going to be playing. He told me we were going upstairs on the wrestling mats to play a dodge ball game. Upstairs on the wrestling mats was a small area and we only went up there if we had a small class. I lucked out big time because we have to take our shoes off when we play on the mats.  I got done with @CAPS1 and the bell rang to tell us school was over. I got dressed into my normal clothes and headed home. My friend @PERSON1 was waiting outside for me. We started heading home and I slide around with every step I took. The sun had melted the top layer of snow and turned it into ice. I looked over at @LOCATION1 and laughed. He laughed too. The whole way home I was skating on ice. It was a really fun day. Except right when I got home I fell on the deck because the step was icy."	38
20872	"Laughter is a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 have been there, I know @CAPS4 have. We all have. @CAPS4 have been that kid that just did not feel like helping your nagging parent out. Especially when your dad had been in a huge motorcycle wreck and @CAPS4 had been waiting on him hand and foot the entire visit there.@CAPS10 had gone through a couple of surgeries and was put on a lot of medications for @CAPS2. I had noticed @CAPS10 was not really himself on all these pills. His abnormality was taking a toll on the family. Through all these stressful times, we were also worried about @CAPS6 stepmother. She was pregnant with her second child. There was also stress of having @CAPS6 fathers business being the main income, and him not being able to work. @CAPS6 father felt helpless, his leg was to weak for him to be doing anything.@CAPS10 would micromanage everything, and tell @CAPS4 were doing things all wrong. The was starting to cause a lot of tension within the house.  Today was the day. Isabelle (@CAPS6 little sister) and I were left alone with @CAPS6 with dad for the first time.I was going to the kitchen to get scissors for an art project we were doing in @CAPS6 room. Father asked asked if I could make him some oatmeal, of course with full hands I said ""@CAPS5, but I will when I'm done."" @CAPS6 father took that as disrespect, and hobbled over to me with his crutches. @CAPS10 was yelling at me which was upsetting, so instead of fighting back i headed to @CAPS6 room.The anger in his voice was excruciating. I turned around, told him to stop yelling, and headed back to @CAPS6 room. That's when it happened. @CAPS6 father hooked the end of a little kids chair and flung it down the hallway. It bounced off the walls, breaking an outlet shell, putting a hole in the wall, and hitting @CAPS6 knee. I didn't say anything, being afraid of what would happen next. Slamming the door luckily I had the phone and I called @CAPS6 grandmother. I told her on a voice mail that I wanted her to pick me up and take me to her house. She showed up an hour or so later not knowing I left a voice mail. I explained what happened, and she comforted @CAPS6 sister and I telling us it would be okay. @CAPS6 grandmother sat us all in the living room to try and resolve the situation. By then @CAPS6 dad had come to his senses and apologized to both of us. @CAPS10 used popcorn and candy to make us forgive him, then @CAPS10 started making fun, and jokes. Every time there is a fight or disagreeing @CAPS6 dad always cracks a few jokes to get us in a better mood. The one thing different this time is after @CAPS10 told some jokes, @CAPS10 apologized again. This time explaining why @CAPS10 was sorry. I liked that which made the rest of the day quite a joy.  "" @CAPS7 made laughter to be a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 medicine, @NUM1 minutes of laughter is equal to two hours of @CAPS2 @CAPS3."" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 on a @DATE1 service talked about this. Laughter can truly mend a broken heart. The @CAPS2 that @CAPS6 sister an I went through that day was all over after the laughter @CAPS6 father gave us. ""Laughter can save us."" @CAPS10 also stated. After this day I believe with a little humor @CAPS6 father an I's relationship can get through anything. I would never let one mistake control a life time bond. Laughter will always be in our hearts."	38
20879	"Angelina @CAPS1 @CAPS2 a year ago, some time in the @DATE2, I was at my best friend @PERSON1's house for a sleepover after her @CAPS3 party. We were exhausted from swimming at her @CAPS4's pool and taking her dog for a walk, not to mention the partying, and we would have been asleep if it weren't for the family-sized bag of @CAPS5 and six pack of @ORGANIZATION1 we'd consumed not an hour before. At around three in the @TIME1, our childish minds searching for something to do, we decided it was a good idea to paint the tips of our tongues blue with nail polish in hopes of them glowing in the dark when held to the black light on her windowsill. I was the first one daring enough to touch my tongue to the brush, and boy did it hurt! The acid and alcohol in the polish stung my taste buds. The next day was @DATE1 and, after hanging out at @LOCATION1's house for the afternoon, we came to my house for another sleepover, which is what we did and sometimes still do every time we are together. That night, this time around two in the @TIME1, we grew hungry again and came downstairs to get a snack before retreating back to my room and @PERSON1 playing on my computer while I used her phone to text my former crush. @PERSON1 got jars or ice water, I still don't know why she uses jars instead of cups, interrupted my spinning around the kitchen floor with my new socks, and we had a random instantaneous ice chugging contest. After ten seconds of silence, I glanced over my jar at @LOCATION1, who wasn't even half done with her water. There, on her chin, was a speck, a dot, a glob, of blue nail polish. I attempted a gasp to give me enough air to start laughing at her, but instead of air coming into my windpipe, and ice cube made its way in. Choking, laughing, falling on the floor, laughing, nail polish-picking, and more laughing, we stood in the middle of the kitchen with nothing to actually laugh at that was that funny. @PERSON1 dropped her jar and it shattered on the floor, sending shards of glass and water across the kitchen, but that's okay. We were having fun, and, guess what, we fell asleep on the kitchen floor not ten minutes later. I suppose we were more tired then we thought. We did clean up the glass though. Some people say laughing is the best medicine a doctor can use, that it can cure any disease, that it can brighten anyone's day. Dentist's apprentices use laughing gas that makes people loopy and smile a lot when they do operations on your teeth, and it doesn't hurt as much, until the day after, but that's because you just had a tooth pulled. Today @PERSON1 and I are still best friends. Sure, we get in fights, but they end within a week or two. The longest fight we were ever in lasted a month and a half, and it was a misunderstood rumor another friend of mine had started, and ended by us both laughing @CAPS2 how stupid whatever happened really was. Within the five or six years of @PERSON1 and I being friends, we realized laughing is healthy and good for you, both physically and emotionally to relieve stress, so every time we see each other we laugh as much as possible. Inside jokes popping up from something said that was totally unrelated, a funny-looking person walking down the side of the road, or just our own minds saying its time to be happy again, it all triggers laughter. Sometimes it hurts, but we cant help laughing harder, because its fun."	40
20885	"   Humor is a huge part of who i am,and i love making people laugh, but this story is about an event that made my whole family fall down laughing on the floor. It all started one @DATE1 when my cousin received a trampoline for his birthday. It was a great day not only for him but for the rest of us kids too because we all could go and play on it whenever we wanted. We were always over at my cousins house after that. We would have competitions to see who could jump the highest or who could do the coolest trick. Sometimes we would fall off or one of us would get hurt and then my aunt and uncle wouldn't let us play on it for a while but they would always cave and let us back on it. It wasn't until a few months later that we all witnessed the funniest accident that any of us had ever seen in our life time. It all started out at my aunts birthday party. Usually she had it at some fancy restaurant but not this year, this year she decided just to have it at home to save some money. So we all show up for my aunts party my mom, my brothers, and me. First off we do all the regular birthday things, the meeting of family members, eating some food, and singing happy birthday. Basically in my eyes it was all the boring stuff. I mean come on there was a trampoline out in the back yard just waiting to be jumped on but the adults wouldn't let us get anywhere near it until we had ate. Finally everyone was done eating and they were going to let us kids go have our fun. It started off as normal as any other day we went to play on the trampoline but little did we know that all of our stomachs would be hurting from laughing in a few hours from an even that was about to transpire"	34
20893	" Having laughter in your life is a big part in showing who you really are. Some people think that you @MONTH1 be one person who can be ""stuck up"" or a funny person who can really be ""stuck up"", but in the end your all laughing together no matter who they are. When you see something happen real funny you can't help but laugh. Or even when you get nervous all people do is laugh it off. All different kinds of people have different ways in showing how they can use laughter in their own lives. ""@CAPS1 are blue, roses are red, your always in my head, i want you in my bed...."" That's suppose to be a love poem. When your in a relationship with someone you might think your in love. If your partner is never open about anything, you probably don't have a great relationship. See if you can argue one moment with your lover then the next laugh it off because you were silly to be even discussing it. Your relationship involves love and laughter. Friendship is another great relationship for laughter. For example my friend and I were invited to a birthday party, she had lots of fun games and lots of food. My friend that went with me to the party her name is @PERSON1. It was gettting late, and we were tired. We were not doing anything this was probably around @NUM1 in the @TIME1. See us for some reason do love to sleep, but we were just having such a great time at our friends house we just didn't want the night to end at all.  We al sat and layed there on the ground and bed for about four hour earlier watching ""@CAPS2 A"". Then out of random i started to laugh at @LOCATION1, and till this day I don't know why i was laughing at her. All of the sudden she started to laugh a lot harder at me, then I was starting to laugh harder just because she was laughing. I was almost to the point where I couldn't breathe no more. So I got up walk my self to the bathroom, but i could still hear @CAPS3 laughter in the room which was still making me laugh.  Since that night @PERSON1 and I got a lot closer in our friendship. Laughter is a lot in life. It might make you feel like your dying sometimes, but that feeling is worth it."	37
20898	" @CAPS6 only happened a few weeks ago on a day the all the students were supposed to be out having fun or sleeping because there was plenty of snow outside. A guy was crying on his chair with his hands over his eyes, a french horn in his lap and his gaze fixed on the ground below him. Sobs choked the sound in the band room but luckily for this guy's pride there weren't too many people in the room to start off with. The guy's head rose up, the tears seemed to eat the self sturdiness of his normal self, and @CAPS2 spoke to the person who always sat to his left. "" @CAPS1 just don't understand @PERSON2"" the broken, voice cracked on words ""I don't care that @CAPS1 play in cascade winds or that @CAPS1 get private lessons or that @CAPS1've gone to state honor band! This @MONTH1 sound like a terrible reason, but i just want to play first because i want to play first, and @CAPS1 never let us play first."" @CAPS2 was right about one thing, @PERSON2 really never let us play first. I somehow understood where @CAPS3 was coming from; @CAPS4 my freshman year i had always sat under him, and him under someone else and so forth. I had never seen him be first chair on anything. And now on his senior year, a prodigy child had come into band and she only knew how to fight for her position as first chair. In short @CAPS3's four hard years of working for the first chair spot in band were summed up to being second best the moment she stepped in the room. The feeling of all his hard work turned into mediocre in his face, with time, had broken him to tears.  @PERSON2 was much better than us and she has the accolades to prove @CAPS6. She had attended cascade winds solo ensemble festival, band camp, and would be going to @LOCATION1 as an ambassador of music. Still something about her having first part still didn't feel quite right. Maybe @CAPS6 was my sense of wanting superiority as well. @PERSON2 took in the words, leaned closer to say. "" I understand that @CAPS1 want first"" @CAPS10 with confident tones she said ""but right now we need specific players in specific spots. I've played harder music and my skills are whats needed on first part. I understand what your feeling, ive been there before.""  @CAPS6 struck me weird that a sophomore was telling this to a senior. How could she have felt what @CAPS2 was feeling? she'd been a prodigy child in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 from the start. I sided with @PERSON1 but @CAPS10 I realized that letting him play a more demanding part would be worse for the band. So i tried siding with @PERSON2 but @CAPS10 all i could think about was that this was @PERSON1's last year to shine as a @CAPS7 @CAPS8 french horn player.They kept going at eachother. Every comment scraping at the already fragile surface of the argument. Minutes made the quarrel more and more volatile.  I had to think faster. @CAPS9 the argument continued like this the horn section would be torn apart and co-operation would be useless. More importantly I would lose two partners that together had uprooted a great deal of musical talent. I slid my chair next to them to tell them my thoughts. ""@CAPS9 a man has no socks,"" I liked starting out my thoughtful speeches with mysterious beginnings, "" @CAPS10 so will..."".And that's as far as i got. I thought @CAPS6 was brilliant, their faces said otherwise. So they called me crazy and giggled @CAPS10 they made fun of me and laughed. Thankfully i was oblivious of the stuff they called me because i really wanted to remember what i wanted to say. @CAPS3 stopped crying, finally, and @PERSON2 got my message that @CAPS3 was a senior and didn't really have many more chances at playing first chair in @CAPS7 @CAPS8 band. They settled the fight with a simple deal; @CAPS3 would get fist chair as soon as we stopped competing. @CAPS4 @CAPS10 I've been the center of being made fun of. But as annoying as @CAPS6 gets sometimes its usually funny for everyone, including myself.  I cant even begin to imagine what band would be like @CAPS9 their enmity had risen to the no forgiveness zone. There had been times before when heated discussions left the stress levels in our section so @CAPS7 @CAPS6 made @CAPS6 hard to breath right. Having laughter come in even right before they were about to rip eachother's faces off gave them time to understand that they had mutual understanding of each other. Or opened their eyes to how long they're going to have to sit next to each other i they were to continue fighing. Either way, @CAPS6's definatley changed the way they feel about eachother; I haven't heard them complian about one another for a while. @CAPS3 is eagerly awaiting his turn to shine and @PERSON2 for better or worse can't wait to see him play."	44
20904	" These are some example that i remember when i had fun and laughter in my life  @CAPS1 all started in the @DATE1 time when i was like @NUM1 years old and my cousins were living with @CAPS3 cause they had just moved down to @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION2. @CAPS1 was fun having them around. @CAPS3 and my cousin @PERSON7 and my cousin @PERSON3 who lived right next to @CAPS3 would always ride bike. Some times joey would take my bike with out asking @CAPS3 and i would get so mad at him.he would take my bike like if @CAPS1 was his. @CAPS3 and my cousins would always race down the street with our bikes.  I was always the one to win the race the kind of bike i has was a @PERSON4 @CAPS1 was a @CAPS2 bike witch is a bike made for the dirt and to race. @CAPS3 and my cousins would go behind some apartment down are street and there was a ramp that we made. @CAPS1 was just dirt but @CAPS1 was hard. One day when @CAPS1 was raining so hard @CAPS3 , @PERSON7 , @PERSON3 and another neighbor of our asked us to come out side to we asked our parents if we could and my parents said @CAPS1 was okay same with @PERSON3. Joeys @CAPS4 said he could not cause @CAPS1 was raining hard outside but he still came outside. we had got all muddy i ad fell of my bike trying to go up the ramp while @CAPS1 was all muddy. then my cousin got like beat up from all the time he fell off the bike.  By the time we were done playing out side we were so muddy and our bikes were filled with dirt. my @CAPS4 was mad at @CAPS3 cause i was so muddy so she send @CAPS3 straight to the shower . @CAPS3 and my cousins had a good time that day after we were all done getting cleaned up we were playing super @PERSON5 bros for super @ORGANIZATION1. If we were not playing the super @ORGANIZATION1, riding bikes or getting wet with water gun and water balloons since @CAPS1 was so hot out side. We were probably on our way to the park for free lunch the school would always serve free lunch to who ever want free lunch. a lot of my friends would go to the park and get lunch same with my cousins after we would finish eating @CAPS3 my cousin @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 would always trade @CAPS5 cards or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards back then every body had @CAPS5 or @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 cards. i had piles of cards. @CAPS1 was fun being at the park with friend and family just having a fun time eating playing getting wet in park. When i was in @NUM2 grade @CAPS3 @PERSON2 @CAPS14 and @PERSON6 @CAPS15 were like the three amigos we would stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house like almost every weekend. we would always stay at @ORGANIZATION2 house because his back yard was big and we would always play hide-seek and cause @PERSON6 had like a play room with a pin ball machine a basketball hoop and other games. One time on @ORGANIZATION2 birthday @CAPS3 @PERSON2 and @CAPS17 slept over at @ORGANIZATION2 house and we were just playing video games like one of the games we played was grand theft auto @CAPS18 @CAPS19 @CAPS1 was a cool games.  I think that laughter is a big part in friendship cause if your having a good time hanging around with your friend and just laughing then that mean that hes a good person . If your friends always make you laugh then there good friends to be around with. Like i would always hang around with @PERSON6, and @PERSON2 cause they would always know how to make @CAPS3 laugh .So thats why i think laughter is inportant to havewith friends or family. "	30
20909	" Laughter, everyone from babies to old people do it. Laughter is an element that helps in life. They say that ""laughter is the best medicine"" it truly is. Laughing lets people know that you have a good sense of humor and that you like to have fun and let loose. In any friendship, relationship, job or sport you need to laugh every once in a while. You can't always be serious. Being serious @NUM1 as they say is not good, it makes people seem like they don't know how to enjoy life or they have no sense of humor.  In the @DATE1 I had a rough volleyball season. A lot of my teammates had problems with me, because I was chosen as captain along side my friend @PERSON1. We weren't the most well liked, but we were liked by some. It was hard for @PERSON1 and I to prove that we were right for the position of captains and that we could lead the team. A few of my teammates at the time quit because they did not want to deal with @PERSON1 and I being captains, but as they quit we moved people from junior varsity up to varsity. The new varsity members had it rough, they struggled a bit trying to get the hang, but they did it they managed to get the hang of how varsity plays and practices. Soon after our mishap of having to replace seven out of fourteen players we had our first game. The game was one of the toughest we had the whole season. In our first set of the we didn't exactly have our minds in it for the first of what would be come a five set, game. We battled back and forth a few points in the first set, but we ended up losing that first set. We went into the second set not knowing what we were going to do whether to give up or half-@CAPS1 it was tough, I as one of the captains said ""@CAPS1, we won't get anywhere unless we @CAPS1."" then @PERSON1 says ""I agree, lets @CAPS1 our best and not let them get an easy win."" We did exactly that we tried and we won that second set. It was the third set and we had started to get tired and feel aggravated, so we pushed forward we won the third set. One more set and we would win it. We went on the court and the ball was served we let the ball hit the ground point one to the other team. After that first point it went down hill we let them get the best of us and they won the set. It had come down to the fifth and final set were we would either win or lose. We got on the court knowing that we might lose and started. The first point went to us we went back and forth a ton in the final set. It was a tough battle, but we had done it we won. Later in the season we met the team again and it was a hands down battle we had lost the second time we met them it was not easy at all they didn't allow any room for errors on their behalf, but us we let it all slip. It was time for the state playoffs we had made it to the state finals. The team we were playing was the team we had faced twice before and we were one and one. The line-up was called, national anthem sang, and the coin was flipped, we would receive the serve. The game was in full swing, we were doing great we won the first set by four a tough first game. We went into set two, we lost control. We didn't do what we were suppose to do. We lost the second set it was and confidence hitter. We were down we didn't know what to expect in set three, and as captains the team seeing @PERSON1 and I should have not let ourselves be down. We looked at each other with that look I knew and we just busted out laughing we couldn't stop the team wondered what was wrong. So we explained that in order to win we had to laugh we @MONTH1 feel down, but you have to laugh and the team did we went into the third set confident as ever and we won we didn't stop there we went into the fourth set and won. We had done what we set out to do win! In the end laughing was what we needed to do we had come this far that we could either give up or push and succeed. We looked at the two previous games that we had met the other team before and laughed. We made that our team motto ""laugh until you cry, and cry until you laugh"" the season was great looking back on it we were state champs. Now in @DATE2 season we are hoping to repeat state champs."	34
20915	" @CAPS11 was @DATE1, hot and dry hadn't seen any @CAPS26 for a few miles. We'd been walking for a good six hours now @CAPS18 snacking on left over jerky scraps. @PERSON3 hadn't said much today still pissed off about dropping the can-tine, I would've laughed if the duration of our lives weren't depending on that can-tine. Hadn't heard even a grain of sand shift along the dead dry dirt that day under the blistering sun. No wind no nothing. I looked up the sun was at @CAPS11's peak yet @CAPS11 felt like a few weeks had already gone by. Finally gaining the courage to crack open my wrinkled bloodied lips I managed to sputter something, ""@CAPS1 sound good right about now, @CAPS3't you think?"" @CAPS2 didn't even glance over at me, I couldn't tell if @CAPS2 was @CAPS18 ignoring me or that @CAPS2 was sun burnt so bad his skin would tear @CAPS18 turning his head. ""@CAPS3't make me start singin, you know how bad I'm at singin. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 left me after I started singin to her."" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS4 so I go'n die by myself? Make things better?"" @PERSON3 finally speaking up, surprisingly with his neck still intact. ""@CAPS5 wasn't so bad, @CAPS18 try to imagine that can-tine @CAPS31 had whiskey in @CAPS11. Know how much you hate @CAPS11, yeah?"" I asked kicking a rock. ""@CAPS4 did I ever start riding with you and them outlaws, should've @CAPS18 stayed back home become a lawyer at least make a name for myself."" @CAPS2 muttered looking away. ""@CAPS8 you did, now we can go on ahead or you can go on back that way and get lynched. Maybe go ask @PERSON2 and @ORGANIZATION2's body back by the rocks, give you another reminder of @CAPS9'll happen back down that way."" I gazed into the distance not much to see, except a small brown dot couldn't tell @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was. ""@CAPS9 you reckon that is?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS10 some dead animal."" @CAPS11 had been a few hours since we talked, the brown dot getting a little bit bigger as we drew closer. I still couldn't make out @CAPS9 @CAPS11 was, but I knew @CAPS9 I hoped for @CAPS11 to be. My boots began wearing out a few years ago now revealing a gaping hole of which my big toe couldn't resist sticking out of. ""We're out of jerky, all gone."" @PERSON3 grunted as @CAPS2 tossed the sack over his shoulder. ""@CAPS9 do you think that is anyway?"" @CAPS2 spatted. ""@CAPS3't know but @CAPS11's pretty big and @CAPS29 sun is mighty hot, I reckon @CAPS11's got some nice shade under @CAPS11."" @CAPS11 was nearly dusk, but the dot had grown remarkably larger a mile or so away from @CAPS11 now. ""@CAPS11's getting dark, how we goin see where we steppin?"" @PERSON3 asked watching every step. ""@CAPS17 that hard to walk without lookin."" ""@CAPS18 think of @CAPS11 like @CAPS19 the tail on the donkey but having to walk to the donkey blindfolded."" ""@CAPS20, @ORGANIZATION1 sure knew how to through a party, her pies were mighty fine."" @PERSON3 began fantasizing. Now walking with my arms stretched afar I'd knew if we we're at the object. I retracted my big toe through the hole as to restrain from stubbing @CAPS11 on a rock. Suddenly I heard a loud thud, then I felt something smooth, ""I think we @CAPS28 @CAPS11,"" @PERSON3 said slowly, I now realizing @CAPS9 that thud was. ""@CAPS21 be some abandoned jeep."" ""@CAPS9 we going to do with @CAPS11?"" @PERSON3 asked. ""@CAPS23."" @CAPS24 up over the door onto the front seats the cushioning was firm but comfortable enough to call a bed. I woke to yet another hellish sun in the sky almost laughing down on us. There were a few compartments in the jeep that I began to search through for @CAPS26. ""@CAPS9 you looking for?"" @PERSON3 sighed as @CAPS2 slopped out of the jeep. ""@CAPS26, @CAPS9 else?"" @CAPS27 searching through old dusty papers I managed to find a rock hard piece of gum, a cigar stub, and a half empty bottle of @CAPS9 I'd hoped to be @CAPS26. Oh @CAPS9 I'd given for that bottle to have been filled with @CAPS26. Whiskey was all that I @CAPS28 inside the bottle. Getting out of the dirty automobile I @CAPS28 @PERSON3 sitting against the front tire. ""@CAPS28 some of that favorite drink of yours,"" I said sitting down against the door. ""@CAPS29 all you find?"" @PERSON3 muttered. ""@CAPS30."" I starred out at the horizon, nothing but sand. ""I'm scarred, you scarred?"" @PERSON3 asked looking over to me. ""@CAPS31 thing that scares me is the times @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 caught me snacking on her pies before supper,"" I began to chuckle. ""@CAPS20, that is true,"" @PERSON3 laughed as @CAPS2 wiped drips of sweat off his brow. We @CAPS18 sat there for a few days, @CAPS18 starring and joking. @PERSON3 was a pretty swell guy, @CAPS11's a shame I brought him into all of @CAPS29. @CAPS2 died of a heat stroke. That desert was harsh and unforgiving, @CAPS11's something I'll have to carry forever."	40
20920	" In my storie I am going to tell you about a funny time in my life where me, and my brother liked to pull pranks on my aunt.   @CAPS1 first paragraph is about the first prank that we pulled on my aunt. when i was about six and my brother was four and my aunt had just bought a beautiful purple suade couch, she loved @CAPS1 couch, and me and my brother at the time thought that my aunt had loved @CAPS1 couch more then she loved us. So me and my little brother took two jugs of chocolate syrup, and poor them all over my aunts brand new three thousand dollar couch.    The second prank was just myself, and one day i was playing video games and my aunt was getting ready for work. I was getting very frustrated with the game and i threw my controller down, man my aunt ran over and pop me in the back of my head so fast,and she told me to be a good sport and try it again. But i was upset because i just got popped in the back of my head so i was looking for some revenge, when my aunts goes into the bathroom to go put in her make-@CAPS3 for work, I go into the kitchen and get a grape soda, I walk over to my aunts purse crack open the grape soda and poor it all over the inside of my aunts purse.  The last paragraph is about the worst prank that me and my little brother have ever pulled. One morning when my aunt was at work and my dad was sleep, me and my little brother were sitting on the couch watching television and my little brother says that he has to go to the bathroom and knowing us kids we do everything together so me and my brother go @CAPS3 stairs to the bathroom, and we see the biggest box of fifty-four rolls of soft, lushes toilet paper.Me and my little brother love toilet paper rolls for whatever reason, so we open the box and my brother drops one in the toilet, so I put one in the toilet, then he puts another one in the toilet, then i flush it. Little did we know that it would back fire at us and the toilet started to over flow, but i kept flushing. Then i get another roll and start unwrapping it all over the floor, the my brother gets one and @DATE1 we are knees deep in toilet paper and water. Then our aunt walks through the front door, we don't here her because we are having so much fun in toilet paper and water, then she comes @CAPS3 stairs, goes to the bathroom too see me and my brother and a bathroom thrashed, full of toilet paper and water. But the only thing that she says to us is. CLEAN @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! She slams the door then me and my brother look at eachother then start cleaning. Then finally after hours of cleaning the bathroom is back to the way it should be.   @CAPS1 is the conclusion of my storie about the three worst pranks that me and my little brother have pulled on our aunt.   "	32
20925	" There was this time during @CAPS1 vacation, and their was a lot of snow o n the ground. My cousin @CAPS2, brother @CAPS3 and I were all getting together and going to go out to my grandparents. My brother @CAPS3 lives in @LOCATION2 and my cousin @CAPS2, and I live here in @LOCATION1. So it wasn't that hard trying to get us cousins all together. We were all getting together to go out to my grandparents and go snowmobiling together and stay the night out their for a couple of nights. When all got together, and were starting to go out there it was getting to late to go snowmobiling. We were all very kind of sad but it was okay. We just watched movies off direct @LOCATION3, and waited for the morning to come. Once morning came of course it was way to cold to go out right when we woke up. So we made a big breakfast and after breakfast we all got ready and than sat around until it was warmer to go outside. Finally it was the afternoon! We all got dressed into warm clothes to go out an go snowmobiling. We all went outside and my grandpa had one of the snowmobiles ready for us and behind it was the hood of a truck so he could pull us from behind with it. My grandpa was driving the snowmobile and us kids were in the back. My grandma only went one once with us and than she got off because my grandpa was going way to crazy n we were all getting hit by each other when he was driving. Then once us kids were the only ones on the hood by grandpa was starting to go really fast! I was the only one who was covered in snow, and i looked like a snowman. It was so funny! My grandpa went running inside to get my grandpas camera so she could take some pictures. It took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures. Then when she was done we went back to snowmobiling for the rest of the day. After we got all done for the day I than really looked like a snowman. It was a fun day, and very funny how I looked as a snowman, but afterwords I got really cold. We went inside and I went right in front of the heater to warm up while my grandma was making hot chocolate for all of us."	30
20930	"                             Living, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Laughter     @CAPS4 to this @DATE1 I don't remember exactly why I was laughing. All I can remember, vividly, in my mind is the look on my grandfathers face. He had on the same smile he always wore during times of joy. It was a wide warm grin he would shine your way every so often. As I laughed uncontrollably that @DATE1, so many years ago, he shined his happiness @CAPS1 love down on me for so long that I will never forget a single wrinkle in his grin. My @CAPS16, who we all called @CAPS5, had a way of keeping the peace @CAPS1 happiness in everything. No matter how bad things were within our family, he would always make things right. No one could get angry @CAPS3 @CAPS5, @CAPS1 no one could stay sad when he smiled. That's just the kind of guy he was. @CAPS5 was a big part of our family gatherings, just like the one we had on my @DATE1 @DATE1 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. That @DATE1 was our family's @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5, soon after, he passed away. When I look back @CAPS1 realize how important that @DATE1 was I can see that it was a perfect @CAPS8 for everyone. It was a happy @DATE1 @CAPS1 my @DATE1 memories of my @CAPS16 were of his great big happy grin shining down on me while I giggled away during a card game.     When that @CAPS8 kicked off, in the early morning, the weather was already proving to be spectacular. Every one in my family was in high spirits @CAPS1 was ready to enjoy the @DATE1 @CAPS3 family. My favorite activity during each @CAPS1 every family event is to play my favorite games @CAPS3 everyone. Our family has a few specific games that are a tradition during family gatherings. One of our favorites is called @CAPS12-@CAPS13. Now @CAPS12-@CAPS13 was one of the many games that my @CAPS16 was very good at playing. He rarely ever lost a game, @CAPS1 would not finish playing until he had won at least once. So when everyone was assembled at our house, I convinced @CAPS5 @CAPS1 my cousin @PERSON1 to play @CAPS12-@CAPS13 @CAPS3 me. We went into the spare room @CAPS1 starting dealing out the cards. About a half an hour later we were still playing, @CAPS1 to no ones surprise, @CAPS5 was winning. It was just before the food was ready @CAPS1 we were about halfway through the game when either my cousin @PERSON1, or @CAPS5 said something to me that I thought was the funniest thing my tiny @NUM1 year old ears had ever heard, @CAPS1 I began to laugh.     My family was so thoroughly entertained @CAPS3 my laughter that they could not keep their smiles @CAPS1 laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine. It seemed that my senseless laughing created instant joy to my family, including my @CAPS16. @CAPS5' smile was one of the greatest things my little eyes looked up at during my childhood. It was something so imaginary, yet so colorful @CAPS1 vivid in front of me,that I would worship his smile like I was seeing my first solar eclipse. I never quite understood, at such a young age what was so fascinating about his smile, but now I do understand. @CAPS5' smile showed true, wholesome, unbreakable joy. His smile didn't come out all too often so when it did, you knew something good was happening.    No one knew that was our @DATE1 @CAPS8 @CAPS3 @CAPS5. I most certainly could not imagine it to be the @DATE1 I would spend @CAPS3 my @CAPS16. Everything was so perfect @CAPS1 so increasingly happy, it seemed to be a crime to end his life during such a time of joy. Although if I were him, @CAPS1 if I had to choose my @DATE1 @CAPS8, that @DATE1 would be perfect. My single memory of that @DATE1 was laughing, @CAPS1 being happy. I can't think of any better way to spend my @DATE1 bit a time @CAPS3 @CAPS5 then a @DATE1 where we were both completely satisfied in our card game, laughter, @CAPS1 smiles.    Laughter is a funny thing. It is unique in every person, @CAPS1 can range from any kind of humor to pure happiness. Laughter brings hope in times of doubt @CAPS1 never fails to make someone smile. Someone, somewhere started a quote that says, ""@CAPS25. Laugh. Love."" I believe those three words can combine together, @CAPS1 act separately to sum up a perfect life for anyone willing to @CAPS25 out the true, meaningful definition of each of those words. Laughter brings smiles of happiness, humor, @CAPS1 love. Love brings us all together, @CAPS1 when we strive to be happy @CAPS1 to love, that is when we can truly @CAPS25. My grandfather loved each @CAPS1 every one of his family @CAPS1 friends @CAPS1 made a priority of keeping them happy. He lived his life the best way that I believe anyone could ever @CAPS25 it. He died after a life full of love happiness @CAPS1, most importantly, the very special gift of laughter.        "	40
20936	" A few years ago, when I was @NUM1, I decided to do an experiment on laughing and the color of the clothes people wear. I realized that I laughed a lot and I was almost always happy because of @CAPS11, I did really @CAPS1 in school, and I also had a very 'up' attitude. @CAPS6 clothes were all very bright and 'happy' colors. I had a theory that the less someone laughed, and the darker colored clothes they wore, would make their mood and attitude would dip. The experiment would last one week, and in that time I would try @CAPS7 to laugh and gradually start wearing darker and darker clothes until I got to black, to see how I would be affected, if affected at all. To get started, I had to first tell everyone what I was doing and ask them to try @CAPS7 to make me laugh on purpose. Then I had to go to the store and get new clothes that had no bright colors on them. That was the hardest part because I saw a lot of cute clothes, but they were too colorful. After that i only had to wait for the @DATE2 to end and @DATE3 to begin. @DATE3 @TIME1 I woke up and did @CAPS6 usual daily routine, then tried on @CAPS6 new clothes. When I got to school, I noticed the surprised looks from @CAPS6 classmates @CAPS2 they took in @CAPS6 outfit. @CAPS11 was pretty tough @CAPS7 to laugh at some of their expressions but I couldn't, because that would ruin what I was trying to accomplish. Throughout the day, I got comments on @CAPS6 clothing, and some of @CAPS6 teachers were worried because I wasn't laughing @CAPS2 usual but when I told them of @CAPS6 experiment, they understood and said, ""@CAPS1 luck."" @CAPS2 the day came to an end, I was satisfied with @CAPS6 success and quickly fell asleep. The next two days went pretty much the same, and I was wondering if @CAPS6 theory would be proven wrong. But on @DATE1 @TIME1 @CAPS6 mom pointed out that I seemed different.  ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 okay?"" she asked. ""@CAPS4 don't seem @CAPS2 energetic @TIME1, and your @CAPS7 smiling at all. Your @CAPS7 sick @CAPS3 @CAPS4?"" I told her that I was fine. At school, I was asked the same thing, and after a while @CAPS11 got really annoying. I got mad and yelled at them, which I never do, and they apologized. But I felt bad and told them I was sorry and they forgave me, telling me @CAPS11 was probably just the experiment. I got a little happier at the thought that @CAPS6 theory might just be correct. That day went by slowly, and I was glad when @CAPS11 ended. @DATE4 was the last day of @CAPS6 experiment and for that I was happy. I didn't mind the dark clothes and I liked the way they looked on me, but @CAPS11 was hard @CAPS7 laughing, and @CAPS11 was starting to make me feel depressed. That day I decided to wear some of @CAPS6 bright clothes to see if @CAPS11 would change anything, and when I got to school some of @CAPS6 friends didn't recognize me because they got used to seeing me in @CAPS6 other clothes. I didn't feel any different from when I wore @CAPS6 dark clothes. In @CAPS5 I had to stand in front of the class to give @CAPS6 conclusion. ""@CAPS6 theory has been proven semi-correct,"" I stated. ""@CAPS7 laughing did have an effect on @CAPS6 mood and attitude. I was yelling at @CAPS6 friends and feeling sad when I shouldn't have. But I found that wearing dark clothing didn't change anything."" @CAPS6 teacher then said something so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and everyone applauded and said, ""@CAPS9 back @CAPS10!"" @CAPS11 feels really @CAPS1 to laugh again."	44
20943	"Laughter is the best medicine Many people say laughter is the best medicine. I for one, agree. The reason why is that in many points of @CAPS27 life, laughter has helped me, or others, feel a whole lot better. @CAPS27 mother recently got surgery on her shoulder. @CAPS4 had medicine @CAPS2 all @CAPS34 I think the best @CAPS4 took was three nights ago when I was with her in her room...Doing a word-search.  It was @DATE1 @TIME1. Every @DATE1 @CAPS27 step dad's kids come over for dinner. @CAPS27 mom wasn't really feeling well so @CAPS4 went upstairs @CAPS2 started on her big book of word-searches. @CAPS27 step-sister had recently gotten a new car so @CAPS4 @CAPS2 @CAPS27 step-dad were outside looking at it. I went out for @CAPS19 two minutes then came back inside. @CAPS27 step-brother was on @CAPS27 step-dad's iPad. He showed me this game on @CAPS22 @CAPS2 we started playing. A few minutes later @PERSON2, @CAPS27 step dad, said that he was going to @ORGANIZATION1. Katie, @CAPS27 step-sister, @CAPS2 @PERSON1, @CAPS27 step-brother, decided to @CAPS46 with them. @PERSON2 went upstairs to ask @CAPS27 mom if @CAPS4 needed anything. Then they left @CAPS2 I went upstairs to check on her. I saw @CAPS4 was going her word-search @CAPS2 I started to help her.  I don't remember the name of the word-search @CAPS34 we did several. Since @CAPS4 had already started I was looking over the letters, looking for another word. Apparently I wasn't looking close enough because I swore I saw a word that wasn't even in the puzzle. So I said it @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom said, ""@CAPS1 me?"" @CAPS2 I started laughing. I repeated myself @CAPS2 we were both laughing. After that wore off we finished the word-search @CAPS2 started a new one. This one was called ""@CAPS3."" @CAPS4 took the book @CAPS2 looked over the list @CAPS2 suddenly said ""@CAPS5-winks! Yeah!"" @CAPS2 I looked at her like @CAPS4 was crazy. Which @CAPS4 was. I looked at the list again @CAPS2 I start laughing really hard @CAPS2 ask, ""@CAPS7's @CAPS8?"" I was saying it wrong @CAPS34 when @CAPS24 were laughing that hard, who wouldn't?  ""@CAPS7?"" @CAPS4 asked @CAPS2 I showed it to her. ""@CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13."" @CAPS4 said @CAPS2 we started laughing. ""That sounds like something the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 would say."" I comment @CAPS2 @CAPS27 mom does the little song from the @CAPS15 @CAPS16 song which made me laugh harder. We barely made it through the end of the word-search. @CAPS34 we did. The next one I think was called ""@CAPS19 @CAPS20 @CAPS21"" @CAPS22 were several things on @CAPS22 we didn't know. I asked her @CAPS7 one was @CAPS2 @CAPS4's like, ""I don't know."" @CAPS2 then I asked her another. ""@CAPS24're asking me all the things I don't know."" @CAPS4 said. This word search was kind of funny @CAPS34 only because we were saying the rest of the letters after the actual word which made them pretty funny. I accidentally circled the word ""ear"" because I thought it was on the list. It wasn't. @CAPS34 ""earring"" was. We ended up finding ""hair"" at the end of the ""ear"" I'd circled. ""@CAPS26 thanks for that picture."" @CAPS27 mom said. ""@CAPS7? Ear-hair?"" I asked @CAPS2 we laughed again. When we finished that we went onto ""@CAPS29"". That was a funny word-search. We usually read over the list of words before we look for them. One of the words was ""@CAPS30"" @CAPS2 I laughed @CAPS2 said ""@CAPS26 yeah, I can see someone walking around with a @CAPS30 on their head. '@CAPS32, nice @CAPS30.'"" I said in a weird voice. ""'@CAPS26 thanks. I got it from the @CAPS30 store.'"" I guess I was doing a pretty good job because @CAPS27 mom was laughing really really hard.  ""@CAPS34 wouldn't that be uncomfortable? I mean it's a @CAPS30. I'd think the tail would always be slapping the back of @CAPS20 head."" I said before laughing again. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 walked in the room @CAPS2 looked at us like '@CAPS7 the heck?' @CAPS2 I showed her the word-search. ""@CAPS26, it's not a cowboy hat. It's the full cowboy."" @CAPS4 said, laughing as well. @CAPS27 mom shook her head, trying to say something. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS39, it's things that wear hats."" @CAPS4 managed to get out @CAPS2 I'm looking at her. ""@CAPS7 kind of a hat does a @CAPS30 wear?"" I asked, smirking. @CAPS4 shook her head. ""I don't know."" @CAPS4 said like @CAPS4 was giving up. Katie @CAPS2 @PERSON1 then said good-bye @CAPS2 left. ""@CAPS43, @CAPS39 more. I need to take @CAPS27 pills."" I snorted at @CAPS7 @CAPS4 said. ""@CAPS39, @CAPS24 really don't need any pills."" @CAPS4 looks at me like @CAPS4 was going to punch me. @CAPS4 might have if I wasn't standing a few feet away. ""@CAPS46 away."" @CAPS4 said with a smile. ""@CAPS48."" I said before turning @CAPS2 walking back to @CAPS27 room. I've had several things like this happen. All of them were really funny. They were the humor that @CAPS24 kind of had to be @CAPS22 to understand. I still said laughter is the best medicine. Mom says its @CAPS49."	40
20948	" During the @CAPS1 break my family went to @LOCATION4 except for my older brother. We were head to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4. The ride there was long but we made it. When I woke up at my grandparents house there was already snow! I was very excited. They got about six to eight inches of snow. We rested before we went out to enjoy the snow. Later while I was outside I got a visit from old friends of mine. I hadn't seen them since @DATE1. We talked and hung out. They told me that I was lucky to get out of school early for @CAPS1 break. They still had to got to school. I told them that if they're lucky then they would have to go to school for only half of the week. And they did get lucky. @DATE3 they went to school and the rest of the week they got off because the roads were icy. I was very happy that they got the rest of the week off, now we were able to actually hang out during the break. That night my grandma made us some barbeque chiken, scalloped potatoes, green beans and corn, and rolls. It was really good. I love my grandmas cooking and she's the head chef at the school that she works at. She is an amazing cook! @DATE2 was a very cold day. My friends invited me to go shoot air soft guns. It would me my first time. Being with my friends again was fun. While I was trying to shoot an air soft gun, my friend @PERSON6 told me that I was shooting it wrong. ""@CAPS3 am I shooting it wrong?"" I asked him. He told me that he didn't really know and that I suck at shooting. I reminded him that it was my first time. Then he put his arms around me to try to help me aim better. It was very awkward but I was a little frustrated. Sometimes I hate it when people try to help me when I don't want it. And that was one of the time. But he was one of my good friends so it wasn't too bad. When we were done, @PERSON6 asked my to hold onto his air soft gun while he was getting something. He had also told me that the safety was on. So while I was waiting, I was spinning the gun on one of my fingers and somehow I shot him in the back. He freaked out a little bit and asked why I shot him.  ""I didn't mean too. I was spinning the gun on my finger and somehow I shot you! Pluse you said that the safety was on!"" @PERSON6 forgave me and told me that it wasn't my fault because it wasn't. He saw that our friends @NUM1, @PERSON3, @LOCATION3, @PERSON1 were laughing and so was my cousin @PERSON4. @CAPS4 confesed that he was the one that shot @PERSON6 in the back. So @PERSON6 decide that he was going to shoot @CAPS4 back. Then somehow it beacame an all out shooting between all of us. I had lots of fun that day. It's one of my favorite memories when I was there. While I was still in @LOCATION4, my @CAPS5 @DATE4 asked if I can babysit for her. So the next day after lunch I let my little cousin @PERSON2 play in the backyard after he was done eating. My baby cousin @PERSON5 was taking a nap so I told @PERSON2 that we can't be to loud. I decide to go play outside in the snow with him. After we were done we decided to go back into the house. We got locked out. Then I remembered that @TIME1 when my @CAPS5 was still home, @PERSON2 was messing with the lock. So I decided to go around the house and try the front door. It was locked too. @PERSON2 told me that the garage door can open, but he didn't know the code. I felt really stupid. After a couple minutes more we went over to one of their neighbors house so that I can call my @CAPS5 because I didn't have her cell phone number. But the neighbor only had their house number. Then I called my dad so that I can get her number. I told him what happend and he started to laugh. @PERSON5 was still taking her nap so things were still kind of ok. I called my @CAPS5 and we waited until she got home. She told me that it was ok and it happend to her twice while @PERSON5 was taking a nap. She also said that sometimes before she goes outside she takes a key with her of makes sure that the door was unlock. I learned a little lesson that day. But other than that @PERSON2 and I had fun outside.  I had such a great time while I was in @LOCATION4. Just being in @LOCATION4 is one of my favorite places to be. Espicially when I'm with my friends and family."	40
20956	"Laughter can be used for many things. One of which can be the important part of a relationship. There are many key parts in a relationship. But, the most important one is definitely the part of ""laughter being the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS1 laughter can cure the emotion of being sad. @CAPS1 it doesn't cure it.   If laughter is the shortest distance between two people then if a guy or girl meets someone they like. For instance, I have went up to a girl before and couldn't figure out anything to do or say. So, I just tried my best to make her laugh. It @MONTH1 have taken a few days of trying really hard to do so. But, in the the end, i was more comfortable asking her out and feeling more comfortable around her and her friends. @CAPS3 I can make her laugh I always feel better about myself because it is never a good thing to see her in a bad mood. Now on some occasions I have made people laugh and it not mean anything. But, @CAPS3 I make my girl laugh then it was totally worth it. Because I can cheer her up from being any kind of sad or angry to making her happy and full of laughter. It @CAPS1 helps with being depressed too. Her being depressed is kinda like a train wrecking off its tracks. It never turns out good. But @CAPS3 she is happy, she can be full of joy, all giddy, and @CAPS1 very spontaneous.  I know @CAPS1 being alone and laughing is good. But you can @CAPS1 get called crazy if you are laughing at nothing at all. The best way to know someone is possibly feeling better is laughter. If they laugh then they can't be mad, sad, or any kind of emotion besides happy, or maybe sarcasm. But sarcasm can be blown off like it is nothing. If I ever try sarcasm to make people laugh I always end up offending them. So I always just be myself around everyone I come around.  So if you ever hear that laughter is the shortest distance between two people. You should know that it is true. Because not only do you get to a lot more place and get to know someone more. But, you can also learn valuable things about life through being closer to more people. @CAPS3 you hear that phrase, ask yourself, ""@CAPS2 I capable of making someone laugh? @CAPS2 I able to pull off laughter and actually be close to someone?"" @CAPS3 you do that, you'll know that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people."	36
20963	"                 Laughter at its @CAPS1  Laughter is one ability that everyone in the world has. Not only does it help you make more friends, but it can also turn your day all the way around. The capability to laugh is a huge importance in this world. Without laughter, days would be dull, sad, and somewhat depressing. When I see someone laugh, it brightens my day, makes me smile, and causes me to laugh along with them. By laughing we become happier, learn more about others, and make our bad days better. I have experienced, first hand, the joys laughing can bring after I have had a bad moment, and that is why I believe that laughter is extremely important to have and to keep in your life.  Not everyone can have a great day all the time. Bad days occur, and when they do, seeing one funny incident and laughing about it is what can turn the whole day around and make it great. Many people hear the statement, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people,"" or a statement similar to that one and will never agree with it. Often times we will scoff and disagree completely. It turns out that I used to be one of those people myself. Most days were not the @CAPS1 they could be, plus having to go to school all day long ruined it a little more. People kept telling me that if I laughed once in a while then I might feel better more often, and I @MONTH1 actually have fun when I participated throughout the day. I never believed them, and why should I? How could one action as simple as laughing change the way I feel about everyday life? The possibilities were just to unlikely. I didn't think I'd change my views on it either, until a few years ago.  It started off like any usual day would, not so great. My hair was a mess, my sister @PERSON1 and I could not stop fighting, and my brand new phone broke right as we started our shopping trip to @LOCATION1. I had decided that the day was going to be horrible because so far, nothing had worked out well. As the day went on, nothing worse happened, but nothing better did either. @PERSON1 and I kept traveling around, going to stores, and shopping. Finally, at our last stop we saw a situation occur. As we were sitting at a stop light, waiting for traffic to move, I spotted a strange man sitting across the road all by himself. The man looked as though he had an injury on his foot, and our suspicions were confirmed when he began walking like a hurt penguin would, barely shuffling his feet and bobbing up and down as he moved forward. The sight of this man made me smile, and when I pointed him out to @PERSON1 she started laughing uncontrollably. Then I too, began cracking up. The man with his crazy way of walking had made me laugh had proceeded to turn my entire day around. What I thought was impossible turned out to be the exact opposite, possible. Laughing could bring you closer to others and make your day more amazing.  As a result of my trip with my sister that day, my views and beliefs about laughing were changed greatly. Laughter actually was the shortest distance between two people. Even though my little sister and I were arguing before the funny man came, after we were done laughing about him we realized that in the span of a few minutes we had become closer than ever before. It is crazy to think that one incident can change your mind about some of your strong beliefs, but it happened, and that day is now a memory that I am going to keep with me forever. I'm happy it happened because as a result of it I have begun to think differently about laughter and the effect it can have on certain situations in my life. I now think of laughter as one of the greatest pastimes to have and do it quite often."	40
20968	"                          Laughing is the key of happiness. Is a moment that is remember by many people. You share many laughs with friends, family and sometimes strangers. When you laugh with someone it shows that you have something in common; you both think something is funny and it could build a strong relationship. For me laughing means a lot, i laugh everyday. I will not forget the time when i was really mad at my dad and then laughter fixed the problem. One night me and my dad were in my house in the kitchen and he was arguing with me about my grades. I told him I could still fix them that there was a solution. He was calling me a liar, and more anger kept on building up. He was so hard headed and I couldn't get through his thoughts. He was saying that i could not fixed what i have done: whats done is done. I was getting really mad, I wanted him to go away and i thought i was not ever going to talk to him. We had a lack of trust and i just wanted to tell him he was wrong. I knew he would have got more mad and we were gonna end up screaming at each other. It got me so mad that he couldn't listen. My dad said he wanted the best from me, and he was disappointed. I got really sad because my dad was the kind of guy that was all ways telling jokes and teasing everyone. He always made my day by making me laugh. Usually when he would get me in trouble, it would end up with a joke at the end. The jokes he made when i was sad or mad would build our relationship stronger; we would always end up laughing. Later the night we were with all my family cutting my niece's cake and me and my dad were not talking. As we were singing happy birthday i would glare at him and look down. He was looking at me as if he was all tough. Then we were all saying ""-í@CAPS1 le sople!"", which means blow out the candles in @CAPS2. All of the sudden my uncle blows out the candle on accident and me and my dad stared at each other and laughed so hard. We were crying of laughter and we couldn't stop laughing. It felt great laughing at the same thing and sharing a moment together and putting aside our anger. My dad would try not to laugh but the more he tried the louder his laugh was. It was only me and him who stayed laughing, everyone else giggled. As it was making my dad and my relationship better it build a connection between my family and I. Its a memory that's gonna last a life time, yet it was an important part of my dad and my relationship. Although he was still upset about my grades it was all better. There was a connection between us and we could still look back and laugh about it. I don't know what it was about the night that i found the incident so funny. As it was making my relationship stronger, the distance between me and him didn't matter it was all build up on the memory. Something me and him both share, building a part of him and a part of me. Our problem wasn't fixed but it was as if it was not important, as if laughing made you change and helped us put it aside. Every laughing moment we have now is something me and him share, its now a connection. We both can laugh about the same things and share our thoughts making us stronger. Telling me that while me and him laugh about things is just putting more the negatives away and giving life more meaning. When you know you're happy is when you have a sense of humor. Also when you have those moments with others that you will never forget. The moment when you made laughing an important part of your pass. When all those funny moments become important because that's when you showed you were happy. Its even better when you laugh most of the time because your memories will be all remembered as a happy moment. I know at times i will have moments where i am not laughing, but the key is to always look at the bright side. Even though me and my dad were mad at each other its a memory that will carry on with me forever."	36
20975	" Laughter is a part of life. It can help bring people together or even tear them apart if it is in bad taste. There was a time when me and my cousin @PERSON1 did not really like each other but I had to stay at his house because my mom was out of town. After that night we were closer then brothers and there is one huge funny tale behind it. I was really reluctant to even go over there that night. But my mom told me to stop complaining and to just try to have fun. When I got there we pretty much just watched @LOCATION1 in awkward silence. Then his parents informed us that they were going out and that they would not be home until it was very late. About ten minutes after they left my cousin @PERSON1 turns to me and says ""you want to do something really fun."" @CAPS1 I was at the young age of thirteen years old a could not help but to be interested. So I asked him what this fun thing was and he told me it was a surprise. We left his house and cut through his field to the wall of blackberry bushes that surrounds his field and he showed me a little path through a certain spot. After we got through the bushes we ended up on a gravel road that led to a house that had a lot of land surrounding it. And on the land were what my cousin identified as fainting goats, I had no idea what fainting goats were. So my cousin said he should just show me what they are and what they do. @PERSON1 walked right up to these goats and made a sudden noise, about a quarter of them just fell over stiffened and unmoving. I was roaring with laughter at the fact that these goats fainted when they got scared. We spent about forty five minutes scaring them and watching them faint. No matter how many times we did it, we found it no less amusing then the first time. The funniest thing by far that happened that night, started off when @PERSON1 informed me that he brought an @NUM1 firework. We put it in the middle of where all the goats had flocked to and lit it. It went off and the bang that was as loud as a gunshot. As one entity the goats all collapsed and we were doubled up with laughter, that is until the people in the house came out side. We ran like our life's depended on it, we flew down the road through the blackberry path, trough the field and straight into @PERSON1's house. We sat down on the couch then we looked at each other, we burst out laughing, my ribs were aching from it, I was light headed with laughter. His parents got home about a minute after we calmed down which we also found extremely funny. As soon as they went to bed we burst into silent giggles. That was one of the funnest times I've had with my cousin and even tough we did not like each other before hand, we ended up becoming brothers in all but blood, but we were cousins so maybe even a little bit by blood but mostly brothers in laughter."	36
20982	" One day my friends and I went to a friends house and we started playing @CAPS1 box we were laughing having an awesome time. My friend @CAPS2 started telling jokes and all my friends started laughing hysterically. My friend @CAPS3 was drinking milk at that time and @CAPS5 laughed so hard that milk started coming out of his nose, that was also funny but gross at the same time. @CAPS6 was the sad one of the whole group that was there, we all asked him, @CAPS4 was @CAPS5 so sad @CAPS5 answered that @CAPS5 heard that his girlfriend wanted to break up with him. So @CAPS5 asked us how to keep her interested, and we said that @CAPS5 should tell her some jokes to make her laugh. @CAPS5 said that @CAPS5 would think about it @CAPS6 was a real funny person and a blast to hang out with, so we didn't really worry about it so much, we thought that everything would be fine. So after all that @CAPS5 left and we started hanging out in my friend, @CAPS7's living room. We were hanging out and just talking about who was the hottest girl at school. So an hour past and my friend @CAPS6 came back. @CAPS5 came and sat with us and yelled I didn't work man, I was like okay calm down, @CAPS9 happened I asked?. @CAPS5 said, she didn't think it was funny she thought that I was being dumb and just plain silly. Oh did she really say silly that's not I word i thought she knew, everyone laughed, no @CAPS6 I was just messing with you man don't get mad come on now. So @CAPS6 left after @CAPS5 yelled at me, @CAPS5 left and all of us guys started laughing I thought that @CAPS5 was just but hurt and @CAPS5 would get over it. an hour past and my phone starts ringing and I look who's calling and it @CAPS6 s ex girlfriend. Surprised I answer and I tell her that @CAPS6 wasn't with us that I would tell him to call you later, I said that because @CAPS5 would use my phone to talk to her, but then she replied that she wanted to talk to me so I was like okay so we started talking and she is telling me that she likes me... I start cracking up in laughter. She got all sad and mad at me because of me laughing. But I told that it was cool that she did so I told her I have to go and we hanged up... I couldn't help my self i started cracking up again and so that's how my day ended in laughter and it was like that all day                                       "	32
20988	"  What's Laughter if not a smile, a small chunk of happiness like a chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven, chocolate oozing out of the sides like waterfalls. Laughter can come from a joke, a awkward situation or just about anything. Laughter can be the thing that bonds a friendship. I'm going to tell @CAPS5 a true story surrounding the matter of laughter and how it has been involved in a relationship of my own. It was my first day of high school, I walked in the school looking down at my shoes. I could feel the people around me staring at me but I wasn't sure if I should look back at them and smile or if I should just keep to myself, so I said nothing. I went to the office and I asked them how to find drama class, they give me a map that I had no idea how to read and sent me off. By this time I was scared. A tall @CAPS1 guy with brown shaggy hair and a flannel jacket bumps into me and instead of an ""I'm sorry"" or even a polite ""@CAPS2 me"" he looked at me disgusted and continued down the hallway. It took me some time but I finally found my drama class. The teacher wasn't nice to me, it seemed like she hated everyone. She was kind of rounder and she had short blond hair. Her name was @PERSON1 and she is not in a good mood today. There was a girl sitting next to me and she looked just as scared as I felt. During the first @NUM1 minutes of class we glanced at each other a few times but we said nothing. About half way through the class the girl next to me asked my name, I replied ""@CAPS3"" extremely quietly. As I went to turn away she grabbed my attention by whispering to me, she chuckled ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5 see what she's wearing? What are teachers thinking when they get dressed in the morning?"" I started laughing hysterically. The large teacher lurking in front of me said ""@CAPS5 two, hallway, now!"" I didn't know if laughing was an option but as soon as I stepped out of that door a grin crossed my face and I fell on the floor laughing. I couldn't control myself. Don't get me wrong I didn't think us getting into trouble was funny but this bitter teacher was such a disappointment. Drama teachers are supposed to be fun and nice, or so I thought. The next class period I walked through the auditorium doors and found myself a seat close to the back, next to @CAPS6. @PERSON1 was wearing a green top that looked like it had been spattered with baby throw up, a pair of light blue skinny jean that did not flatter her body, and a pair of hot pink @NUM2 inch high heels. Today she was in a great mood, @CAPS5 could tell by the big fat smile on her face. When anyone talked she would burn a whole in there foreheads with her eyes. It was like getting stung by a bee on a hot @DATE1 day. We would all laugh behind her back but that's the way we got through her class alive. After a few minutes of talking she sent us off to @CAPS4 our first scene. The people in my group were @CAPS6, my friend @CAPS8 who I had met in algebra the day before and a girl I didn't know named @ORGANIZATION1'montae. We all got to know each other quite quickly because we all loved the joys of laughing. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was @CAPS9 @CAPS10 as was @CAPS8. @ORGANIZATION1'montae was taller than me by about @NUM3 inches. She had blond in her hair that was only in her bangs. She was stunningly pretty. @CAPS8 was a quiet, @CAPS4 it alone type of person. She was about @NUM4 inches shorter then me and she had short black hair. It was straight, as I would quickly learn it always was. She was stylish, she had on the cutest brown belt and shoes that matched it with skinny jeans and a @CAPS12 jacket. Her whole outfit screamed adorable. We laughed the whole time, making fun of the teacher and telling jokes. We got barely any work done. That was a day I'll never forget. To this day, I'm still good friends with all three of them and often we talk about that day, and how glad we are that we met. So, as @CAPS5 can see laughing is a big part of my relationships. Its a great way to make friends and everyone loves to laugh. Even when @CAPS5 barely know someone @CAPS5 can quickly find out that laughing leads to friendships. It's like being in your favorite place on earth for just a moment. Laughter is a good way to become close to the people around @CAPS5. The next time your with your friends or grouped with strangers tell them a joke. Priceless! "	36
20998	" Life is so uncertain, unfair, and unforgiving, but one simple thing can change that view on the cruelty of the world; laughter. In your deepest concern in your darkest thoughts laughter can bring the sun. Laughter is a cure for the sick, a pill for the wounded, and comfort for the old. We give not even the slightest thought to laughing, when in return it gives us joy and happiness. Laughter is the light at the end of the tunnel, a flashlight for the lost, and a lifeline for the hopeless. Laughter truly is the cure for all of humanity. Explaining laughter is like explaining why we breath, we just do, it's a part of living. It's natural for people to laugh, maybe not always appropriate, but it's something we revert back to in necessary times. Laughing makes dreams, hopes, and puts to rest the thoughts of uncertainty. Laughing is a friend, a helper, and an icebreaker to many leaving joy and hope to everyone that it meets. It's part of life we must cherish every moment we can.  Many times laughter has helped me, but one time sticks out more then the rest. A moment, a simple moment were laughter changed me, my views, and life itself; putting my life into motion. With shoulders slumped I listened to my six period teacher as she droned on about nothing important. I turned around hoping to find something to distract me. When I turned I met eyes with a man I had never had spoken to, he watched me with curiosity waiting for my explanation. I wanted, no, needed to talk to him so I took a chance. ""@CAPS1 you watched wrestling?"" he smiled and chuckled.without that the conversation would @CAPS1 been totally different. He could @CAPS1 ignored me, but he laughed and that altered the course of my life. Soon after that, that man became my boyfriend, because we talked after I asked him that. That laugh made everything so simple, it made the puzzle fall into place. Moments @CAPS1 arise when laughing has dug me a pit of ruins. Even though laughing is such a wonderful thing you still need to be careful and know when the right time to laugh is and when its not. Again a moment that sticks to me was a time when I was young. I played by myself for the most part picking up a barbie I brushed her hair,""@CAPS2 come here."" I heard my father call.I went to the living room where my brother already reside and waited with my barbie. My father kneel to talk,""@CAPS3 going to be leaving soon because she needs sometime. I want you to go with her and make sure everything is okay. I want you to stay with her and I'll see you when I can. I love you @CAPS2 always remember that."" I bubbled with laughter, I didn't realize or even comprehend what was really going on. I laughed as we got into the car, by the time we were gone i realized how serious this issue was. Maybe I didn't hurt anyone by laughing, but it hurt me for not taking it so serious.  Life is never know, we never know where life will take us, lead us, kick us, or drop us. Laughter is an emotion and can cure the wounds, but its also a power we must not mistreat or misuse. Giving us joy and fun, it helps pick us up when we fall and it rejoices us. Laughter is a way of life and the savior of humanity."	36
21003	" It's the first day of high school and your gut is full of butterflies that make you want to run to the bathrooms and hide from the world. I had @CAPS7 friends yet and I was to shy to go and join any of the groups so I walked to all of my classes alone. Students would get in my face wanting to know what school I came from and wanted to know all about me. I remember wanting to be left alone, hidden in my own bubble space. Girls would ask @CAPS5 I was upset since I wasn't smiling or having fun getting to know my new classes. Lunch was much more crowded than my old school. Students would sit in hallways eating their lunch or crowd around one big table chattering loudly to one another. I chewed on my lip looking for a spot that wasn't occupied by students. I found a table near the front of the lunch room that was empty and placed my brown lunch sack in front of me eating my peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Two boys and two girls rushed over and settled down next to me laughing at one another for not getting a seat next to me.""@CAPS1 I'm @PERSON3, what's your name?"" was a skinny boy in a black caps response to me. ""@PERSON1"" was all I replied to all of them who stared at me the entire time.""That's a pretty name, I'm @LOCATION1, this is @LOCATION2, you just met @PERSON3, and @PERSON4 is the funny kid next to you with his orange back pack,"" I smiled and nodded to them @ORGANIZATION2 had on a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 t-shirt and @PERSON2 had on a military uniform that said @CAPS4. They all ate lunch at the school and got pizza or sub sandwiches. They showed pictures of funny events on their phones to everyone even including me.""@CAPS5 that kid isn't careful he might get razor rash."" I said laughing a little looking at the picture of a little boy sliding down a slide that looked like a cheese grader. @PERSON3 took off all his pepperoni and was flinging it randomly in the air. @PERSON2 was going to take a picture of everyone for picture id on her phone. @PERSON4 was next for his picture to be taken when the pepperoni in @LOCATION3's hands slipped and landed smack on @ORGANIZATION1's face. I busted up laughing and everyone at the table joined in. @PERSON3 and I were clenching our stomachs and wiping away tears. @PERSON4 went to the bathroom to wash away the smell from his face and when he returned @PERSON2 said,""@CAPS6 my word you should see your face I took your picture right after the pepperoni hit your face and your picture is just hilarious, your mouth is hanging open like your going to eat something and like your angry."" @PERSON2 handed her phone to one person at a time and we all started to laugh again asking for @PERSON2 to send the picture to each of them.""I was wondering @CAPS5 I could be your guys friend?"" I asked looking them all in the eye. @ORGANIZATION2 was the only one to respond,""@CAPS7 you can't be our friend, @PERSON1 duh @CAPS5 we didn't want to be your friend then we wouldn't be hanging out with you."" @ORGANIZATION2 teased. My twisted gut loosened with re-leaf.""@CAPS8 we probably would have made some excuse to leave,"" @PERSON3 smiled. I laughed at myself for worrying that I wouldn't fit in or have friends who could make me laugh as hard as I did when the pepperoni stuck to @LOCATION4's face."	36
21008	" We all have had times when some thing happened and you just thought of it as a nuisance. But looking back on the same occurrence you just have to laugh at how silly it was. I recall one of these experiences when I went on a motorcycle camping trip this @DATE1. It was a bright and sunny day when my dad dropped me off at the beginning of the main logging road of the area. I decided to keep my pace slow and steady and just enjoy the beautiful scenery. Later that day I found a picturesque place to camp for a few nights on the river. In the @TIME1, I remembered some spurs off the main road from when I have driven with my brother in these woods and decided to go explore some of them near my camp. I decided to go check out one across the river that looked like a fun ride. As I was crossing the it my front tire hit some lose rocks causing me to fall into the water! Thankfully I fell away from my motorcycle, if I hadn't it could very well have fallen on me which, out in the woods by myself, would have put me in quite the predicament. After getting my @ORGANIZATION1 up and out of the water I headed back to camp to dry my clothes off, seeing as how I only brought one set with me. While reading a book and waiting for my clothes to dry I fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up I realized that the sun had been up for some time now so I decided that I had better get going on another ride before the day's out. This time I stayed on my side of the water and went up a steep road that lead up to the top of the ridge. As I climbed it became increasingly warm then I broke through the woods and witnessed a glorious sight. The sun was just cresting the ridge in front of me and I had to stop and bask in the sun shine. After a while of just sitting I got going again. The road I was on started to taper down into a valley. At the bottom of it, flood waters had washed large quantity's of silt over the road and it was still muddy. As I crossed it my wheels started spinning out and flinging mud at me as a result I ended up very dirty. Once again I headed back to camp to wash my clothes in the river. This time I didn't fall a sleep for quite some time and when I did it was a fit full one.upon waking I packed up my meager supply's and headed out to complete my journey. Most of a day got me only half way to my destination so I was forced to stop and rest for the night. Just setting out my tent and getting out some food for dinner and breakfast in the @TIME1 didn't take me very long. Having little to occupy my time I just sat by my fire and pondered my trip and life in general. When I fell asleep I slept soundly until @TIME1. Waking to the sound of birds chirping and the river rushing by me was delightful and invigorating. It only took me a few hours to reach where my dad was going to meet me and take me home.This trip helped me think and gater my thoughts. It also helped me enjoy the little things in life that we so often take for granted. Looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set backs. All in all it was a very good time to gather my thoughts and renew my soul."	40
21014	" One day i was with my friend @PERSON1. We had been friends for a really long time. I was in a bad mood that day because my dog, taco ran away and i had gotten into an arguement with my parents. @CAPS4 asked me if i wanted to go out on a walk, and i said i did. We were really good friends at this piont, and @CAPS4 always knew when something was wrong, even though i think i hide @CAPS1 pretty well. As we wakled, we walked past children playing at the park with thier parents, and a man playing fetch with his dog, @CAPS1 was sunny and warm. @CAPS1 was durring the summer-time. We stood on the bridge for a minute, then @CAPS4 asked me ""whats wrong, @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS1 odl him everything that happend, i told him that my dog had ran away and that my parents were mad at me. I told him that i was sad. I dont know why i opend up to him like that we hardly ever talk about our life drama. we're always laughing and making jokes. I thought @CAPS4 liked me, actually i was hoping @CAPS4 did. I liked him, i had for a while.  We started talking about everything that was going on in our lifes, school, friends, parents, and alot more. @CAPS4 put me in a better mood. We decided to go to the park and sit at the pic-nic tables. We sat across from eachother, and sat there talking for a while. Then @CAPS1 started getting late and i had to get home. I said ""thanks for cheerig me up, i really needed to laugh and smile today."" @CAPS4 looked at me, and took my hand in his and said ""@CAPS5 should always laugh, because @CAPS5 never know who is falling in love with your smile."" and then @CAPS4 kissed me. That is the a day i'll remember for a long time. I'm still with @PERSON1, we've been together for almost @NUM1 months now."	33
21021	" My @CAPS1 year of high school started off less favorable than most. During the end of my eighth grade year I found that my friends were not as loyal as I believed they were at the beginning of our friendship, and in turn started high school without any. It wasn't all bad because I was able to see things for myself for one of the first times in my life. Of course I sulked but looking back on it now I am appreciative of this time that helped me get to know myself better. However one can't go through life without any friends so I quickly tried to conform to what was considered 'normal'. I had luck from the start, but I was still scorned from being deserted by all the people who I once considered friends and in turn took these recipients as little more than acquaintances. Like most acquaintances we only spoke in class and kept the conversation casual about nothing more than trivial facts. I wanted to have 'real' friends, but I wasn't sure what a real friend was. I suppose that these so called acquaintance considered me a friend though I can never be sure whether or not this is true. So I continued through my days with a person to talk to in each class but no one to sit with at lunch. This circumstance however was made more desirable because my sister still attended the high school at this point.  Her presence made my life slightly easier because I could confide in her and even eat lunch with her. People who have always had friends @MONTH1 not understand, but when you have no where to sit at lunch it can be kind of lonely. Fortunately my sister was always there for me, though she did skip a lot of school. And whenever she wasn't there I could rely on her friends to keep me company. I found that even if I couldn't find my own friends I could always share my sisters. This nomad existence continued until the second trimester of my @CAPS1 year. I had all knew classes and felt as if it was a new beginning and anything could happen, and truly anything I could imagine did.  It started out the same as the trimester before had. I went to my first couple classes and gained more acquaintances like usual and felt as if thing might not change after all. However after five minutes of sitting alone in my apparel construction class two girls walked in and sat at my table. Their conversation caught my attention and held it. I knew that it was wrong to listen to others conversations, but I figured that if they didn't want me to hear they would have spoke quietly. Though I can't recall the actual subject of the conversation now, I remember it was a hilarious topic. Even though I took no part in the discussion, I couldn't help but be overcome with laughter as the two spoke. They then began to laugh so hard which resulted in tears filling their eyes. In turn my eyes also began to fill with tears from the extreme amounts of laughter. One of the two girls looked over at me and told her friend out loud to ""look at her, shes laughing so hard at you shes crying!"" I could hardly stop laughing long enough to introduce myself. Before i knew it we became close friends and it was all due to the amazing powers of laughter that can bring to strangers together into best friends."	40
21026	"               Laughter is always the answer. It was freezing and dark outside. The walk home was to long to handle but the laughter that was filling the air made the walk home a little faster and shorter. The cars kept passing and stairing, but all we could do was laugh some more because we knew we were making fools of ourselfs, we didnt care one bit. The weird voices that kept coming out our mouths, the crazy @CAPS1 dance moves and the facial exspressions were the funniest thing to us. Stupid things that people do are the funniest things. Becasue I knew if you laugh more then usual you will build your friendship more and live your life more to the fullest. As @PERSON2 and I were walking back home from @PERSON1 we were dreding the walk home. It seemed like it was going to take two hours because of how long it took to get there when it was really about ten minutes away from my house, not even that. It also felt like we were not making it anywhere because of how slow we were walking and thinking of how long the walk would be. Cars kept passing us but they weren't stairing at us yet. It was silent until something popped up in my brain. I had the best idea so the walk would be faster. I remebered this voice my god brother @CAPS2 that was like @CAPS3 compared to me even though he is younger would always do. It always put a smile on everyone and it was entertaining. This voice I wanted to try it, so I attempted to. We weren't even half way home until I started yelling radom words at cars, it was a dark scary voice and I sounded very controlling.  Then I had the bright idea to sing in this deep creepy voice. That was a bad idea also, @PERSON2 started to dance and cars started to stare at us. @PERSON2 was this tall thin girl that was my bestfriend, she loved piercings and didn't care what others thought of her. I really didnt mind what they thought of us either because people knew we were weird. Watching @PERSON2 dance to my voice was the funniest thing I could ever see. I never thought something could get funnier then that, until she wanted to try the voice. When she tried the voice and it slipped out from her lips I started to bust up laughing and fell to the floor. After about ten minutes we were almost to my house and it felt like our stomachs were going to bust open because of how long and hard we were laughing. While I was thinking to myself i thought""@CAPS4, that seemed like two minutes just to get home.""I knew that if @PERSON2 and I would just think of something to do until we got home then time would go faster. When we walked through the door of my house my mom asked us,""@CAPS5 were you guys dancing while you were waling down the @NUM1 and I just looked at eachother and laughed and told her she doesn't even know how fun it was. Laughter is the only thing that brings two people closer I think. It doesn't matter if you make fools of yourself because you know whats fun. All that matters is that you and are build a relationship together. Doesn't matter if it's just friends trying to get to know eachother more or if it is a boyfriend/girlfriend just having fun and messing around. It's always good to have that laugh here and there and no that you have that connection with the other person and no your friendship is still there. "	32
21032	"The @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 great grandmother once told me that laughing adds and extra five years onto your life, she's currently @NUM1 years old. Laughing can bring a new element to relationships; they embark on a journey, whether it be between two friends, family members, or something more. More or less, laughter is an essential piece. Sometimes you feel closer to people because it breaks down that barrier between what defines acquaintance and friends, but that's actually how I met one of @CAPS3 good friends.  The incoming @CAPS11 were participating a traditional ritual (name game) that the high school puts the incoming @CAPS11 through at orientation. They were placing us in long lines that faced each other. For this particular game you had to shake hands and share your first and last name with your partner along with one interesting fact about yourself. Unsurprisingly, everyone found this task ridiculous and embarrassing, but we were able to laugh if off. A whole new feeling overcame the room. That overwhelming and uneasy feeling simply floated away and all because of laughter. It broke that barrier and allowed us to open up. I guess it really is true that ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" @CAPS4 back some of @CAPS3 best friendships were brought up through laughter. When I joined the cross country team for instance, the whole team unlike most other sports teams was like one big family. We share socks, @CAPS5-@CAPS6, tee shirts, shorts, water, sometimes even our watches, but we've also shared a great amount of laughs. Even while we run we talk to our friends and joke around, but trust that laughing while running is not easy! I think @CAPS3 best memory of it all was when we had our ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The entire team of eighteen @CAPS7 or so met up at @LOCATION1's house about a week before districts. The @CAPS10 had to bring snack foods, @CAPS11 had to bring drinks, and @CAPS12 brought the candy, and the @CAPS13 all chipped in for the ""main ingredient"". That first bit of the @CAPS8 was alright, but all were in anticipation for that hour hand to strike twelve. When it did, we were @CAPS9. The ""main ingredient"" to that @CAPS8 was the toilet paper. We were going @CAPS9 on a tee-pee raid!  The first event was forking the coaches lawn; but not with just any old forks, these forks were special. For some reason the coach had this odd obsession with @CAPS14, so in spite of that a few of the @CAPS7 photo shopped his head onto the bodies of lawn @CAPS14. I was in pure amazement and not laughing was impossible. I don't think I ever could have @CAPS16 up with something so clever.  After that little stop we were onto the main event, the tee-peeing. We tried to tee-pee one of the brother's from the team, but there dad had already been waiting up. The other pair of brother's were next. All the cars slowly approached the culdesac, we lowered the the radios and shut off all the headlights. Just to be safe, everybody made sure to park at least four houses away and left all the doors open for a quick escape. Almost synchronized, everybody threw there first roll towards the the big tree on the side of the house. We kept missing and the rolls were would fall back down and unravel into the street, one could have called us the worst tee-peers ever. Then all of a sudden three figures came bolting @CAPS9 on skateboards with their own rolls of toilet paper yelling, ""@CAPS15! Get back here you forgot something!"". We were being ambushed! Sprinting back, we just barely made it to the cars. Still, something just didn't feel right. There was just this eerie feeling, like being in a horror movie. Then; suddenly, as we began to drive away, something big hit the car. In panic, @ORGANIZATION1 stopped the car and had to get @CAPS9 to make sure nobody had been hit. ""@CAPS16 get your toilet paper!"", a deep voice yelled. All the @CAPS7 started screaming in terror. What was going to happen now? What was even going on? Were we going to be killed? No,and fortunately we weren't killed that @CAPS8! In relief we discovered that it was only @PERSON1, @PERSON2, and @LOCATION2, but I might as well have had a heart attack. Instantaneously, the whole group burst @CAPS9 in laughter and I had been laughing so hard that I began to cry. I've ever laughed so much or so hard in @CAPS3 life and I'll ever forget it.  Laughter @MONTH1 not have brought just two people together, but nearly twenty. When districts came and passed, I know everyone was sad to see the season @CAPS16 to a close. It was the @CAPS13 last season and nobody wanted to see them leave; but all the great times we had will never be lost, and bonds are @CAPS2. "	40
21037	" Shafts of light escape through fogged windows casting a shadowed glare upon the surface of the table. A tremendous sign hovers on a wide oak shelf that borders the entire dining area. @CAPS16 read's ""@CAPS1's"" in great letters buried under decades of dust. My eyes dance among the plethora of mismatched antiques and statues strung throughout the room easily filling every crevice. These objects form a family of outliers, each individually unique belonging @CAPS15 the restaurant. Huge posters of All-@CAPS2 athletes tower among @NUM1-inch flat screens while an acrid scent of molded wood and fermented beer lingers. Numerous bras fall from the ceiling of the bar that sits next @CAPS15 the entrance. The sound of crunching echoes in my ears as waitresses maneuver over fallen peanut shells. That's @CAPS4 sets this place apart from the others. The entire floor is littered with barrels of @TIME1's broken shells and mashed peanuts as @CAPS16 is custom for the customers @CAPS15 throw them on the ground. Of course there's my family; a vivacious group of five squeezing our round frames into a booth that comfortably seats four. We seem @CAPS15 mesh quite nicely with the crowd of miscellaneous objects dressed in our '@DATE1 @CAPS3' attire of skirts and dress suits.  Distracted, I busy myself in the menu browsing for something with a little zest and a lot of calories. A loud smashing noise breaks my attention and I slide the newspaper style menu below my eyes. Across the table sits my grandmother; a petite old lady standing proudly at @NUM2 who devotes her free time in attempting stand up comedy. I study the glass jar of ketchup she's holding and watch her pound the corner on a single peanut. The shell cracks open and @ORGANIZATION1 picks out the nuts sweeping its kernels onto the floor. I giggle @CAPS15 myself surprised at @CAPS4 limits this old lady is willing @CAPS15 go @CAPS15. She proceeds @CAPS15 repeat this process with ten more peanuts until the entire family has stopped in curiosity. Looking up, @LOCATION1 pauses with the jar suspended in her hand. ""@CAPS4? I'm just trying new ways of cracking open the nut."" @LOCATION1 exclaims pausing for a comical response. With no reaction we resume position contemplating our meal choices. Minutes later a hefty waitress reeking of drugstore perfume and @TIME1 nights hangover sets down glasses of water and drags off sluggishly. Raising his glass, @CAPS5 motions us @CAPS15 follow.  ""@CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 calls clinking each of our glasses in turn.  ""@CAPS6! And @CAPS6 @CAPS15 cherry people!"" @LOCATION1 pitches in. ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" I shout automatically. Immediately my parents chuckle because my grandmother has never been funny. @CAPS16's a joke that nobody in the family laughs at @LOCATION1's comments but herself and that's how @CAPS16 remains. Years ago, my brother deemed her jokes the ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10"" because she poses as a comedian but truly isn't. From then on, each time @LOCATION1 would crack a ""joke"" someone was quick @CAPS15 respond with yelling ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10!"" @CAPS15 this day, she has neither improved nor given up daily opportunities @CAPS15 attempt @CAPS15 win over her audience. In quiet defeat @LOCATION1 chuckles @CAPS15 herself and focuses down on the menu. Seconds later she's back in the ring for round two.  ""@CAPS16's noon. So are we having breakfast or lunch? Or should we have..brunch?! I'm dying here just laugh already,"" she pleads. For a moment we all just stare at her. Innocent eyes gaze back; the predator calmly sits awaiting the move of its prey. Then, as if a switch had been flipped, we eye each-other and the ribbon is cut. Tea party giggles erupt into hoarse cries as rolls of thunderous laughter echo through the room. I hand my mother a napkin which she uses @CAPS15 dab jubilant tears. The thick wooden table shutters under the pound of my father's fist slapping the surface in hysteria. I laugh so hard my gut aches and yet I cannot understand why everything is so funny. All the while @ORGANIZATION1 sits in pure delight, tickled by the success of finally earning a sincere response @CAPS15 her notorious off-the-cut ""jokes."" @CAPS16's a wonder we aren't thrown out of the restaurant. Customers in surrounding booths peer over the edge of their bench eying us with distaste. However, this isn't the first and certainly wouldn't be the @TIME1 time my family causes a scene. Plain yet obnoxious jokes is a loosely run comradery in our family that always finds its spot in our books of lasting memoirs. The remainder of the meal was spent in bursts of giggles and we were more than kindly shown out the door once our meal was finished.  Its when you break into hysterics for no monumented reason and can't get through retelling @CAPS16 someone else who doesn't find @CAPS16 nearly as humorous.) @CAPS16's those insignificant moments in life when we're reminded of who we are and the bonds we share. Laughter is a connection, a form of love that cultivates within society and in families with grandmothers such as mine, every ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10"" is worth @CAPS16."	50
21044	" I believe laughter brings many different people together. In my friendships with friends we are always laughing about random, silly, things that happen to us each day. Laughter is an important part of any friendship or relationship. One time when laughter help me out the most was the during fourth grade. Fourth grade had brought so many ups and downs with it which none of us knew it would. My friends and I had the biggest fight over the littlest reason. This fight included my best friend @PERSON2, also my neighbor, @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. We all were very close until this fight which was over my favorite sport, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. Everyone had their sides, @PERSON4 sided with @PERSON2 and I was all alone. @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 didn't side with anyone they just wanted us to get along. It was the hardest for @DATE2 and I because we were best friends and did everything together. All the students in our class knew that and could not believe we had a huge fight. @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 would try as hard as possible to hang out with both of us but somehow it didn't seem like that to @LOCATION1 and I. We both thought that @PERSON1 and @PERSON3 were never hanging out with us.  Soon enough our teacher and student teacher had called our parents to tell them about this fight. I remember every other day someone would go home crying. Our parents had a meeting with our teachers and principal to discuss how they can help us. They concluded with the fact that @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I would being going to see a councilor. @PERSON3 on the other hand got out of seeing the councilor. We found this out when our teacher announced it to the whole class. As @PERSON1 remembers it ""That was the first time, in a long time, you and @PERSON2 actually talked!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON2 or I remember talking but I guess change had start to come. When we went to the councler she was very nice and talked to us in a way we all felt comfortable. She asked us what we missed most about our friendship and all three of us answered laughing. We said that we laughed every day and now we go home crying. She asked us if we liked to play games during the times we used to spend together, we answered yes. She let us play games, such as monopoly, which was really fun. At the end of the day the three of us went back to class smiling and laughing. When we entered the classroom everyone was surprised that we were actually getting along. After school I went home and my mom asked me how the councling session had gone. I smiled and said we all had a blast! The next day the three of us went back to the councler and played more games. This session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us. When we were done writing, all of us read the paper to one another. All having the same message: I wish this had never happened, I miss the laughing, and I will laugh about this fight in the future.  To most extent this message was very true. @DATE1, @PERSON1, @PERSON2 and I are still best friends. Yes, we tell this story to everyone and laugh every time. Most of our friends reactions are shocking because they cant believe we had a fight or they just laugh at how stupid the fight was. Most of our friends ask what the moral of the story was and we simply say ""don't let any little thing get in the way of your friendship and remember to laugh about the good times."" In most ways laughing about this silly fight has brought all of us closer and kept us together. Now we have more and more things we can laugh about.  Every friendship has its ups and downs and along with those comes laughter or crying. In the end the only way that you and your friends can be closer is to laugh. Never miss a moment or second guess a change with your friends. They are always going to be with you along the journey of life and laughter is the key."	36
21053	"I live in a life full of laughter, I can not think of a day that I have not laughed. Even when I went threw the hardest days of my life a little @DATE1, there was still someone to make me or a reason to laugh. I think laughing is the best medicine for a person. If you are someone that can go a day without laughing, I'd love to meet you and make that change! There are a few particular times I can remember that we're just full of laughter, most involving family and friends. The first one that I can remember was when my parents showed me a picture of when I was a little girl, there are many laughing episodes when it come to me as a little kid. The picture they showed me was when it was @DATE2 time and I had no shirt, just shorts on. I was sitting on a sled, facing uphill, with the sun just shining. I can not explain how hard my family and I laughed together just from looking at one picture. Another laughing moment I can remember was not when it happened but when I look back now all I can think to myself is, wow. I was about six @DATE1 old at my best friends house who owned eight lamas, who got to get tied up in the yard everyday. The one I always got to walk was named, @CAPS1. @CAPS1 was sweet, @CAPS2 I though, until one @DATE2 day she decided to drag me across a highway. While I was getting drug across a highway that was usually busy, all I could here was people yelling ""let go of her lead!"" @CAPS2 me being six I thought if I let go that the lama would get hit by a car or never come back. I regretted not letting go once an adult got to me because I was all scraped up and blistered from being drug across the pavement. That is a time in my life I will always look back and laugh, but never forget. The last one, my favorite times in life. This would be pretty much anytime I am with my boyfriend. Favorite time was our trip to the beach for the first time. We had never been there together but, it was amazing! We attempted to ride bikes on the sand, failed, and just laughed about it. Then we decided to just walk around all the beach stores and see if we could find something we might have wanted to buy. Later that day we just went to the beach, walked and felt amazing. The funny part of this trip was when we we're trying to take pictures of each other jumping in the air with the ocean behind us. People were looking at us like we were crazy but, we didn't care because we were having fun and laughing almost the whole time! I think that laughing is a very important part of everyday life, to everyone. If you don't laugh at least once in day then something is wrong. I love looking back at pictures from when I was little, having memories with best friends and their animals, as @CAPS2 as taking trips and just being with my boyfriend. Laughing has helped me a lot in life because it brings me up when I am feeling down."	30
21058	" It is often said that laughter can bring people together. I hold that knowledge to be true. We've all laughed at one point in our lives, whether it was in a group of people, or just laughing, and having a @CAPS9 time. Reality is we are all connected to each other in one very simple way, we all have laughed in our lives. Laughter to everyone means something different. To @CAPS15 laughter can mean that I'm happy and full of life and other times it can simply mean that I feel I really don't know @CAPS22 to do. There's one time though that it meant both. It was a cold, and rainy @DATE1 day in @DATE2. I was with my friends watching movies. When I'm with my friends typically that means we're talking about the latest thing, guys, hair, and whatever else. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON3!"" We heard @PERSON2 scream as @PERSON1 and I walked into my room. ""@CAPS1 boy."" I thought, ""@CAPS3 we @CAPS7 again. I new it would be a mistake to have both of them @CAPS3 at the same time."" @PERSON1 and I exchanged glances, I new she had the same thought going through @CAPS28 head.  ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 happened this time?"" @PERSON1 sighed as we entered the room only to see the two of them going at each other, violently tugging each others hair, slapping each other, @CAPS29 did everything imaginable to each other before I lost it. I hate seeing my friends @CAPS7 at each other the way @CAPS29 were. ""@CAPS4!"" I finally yell. ""@CAPS3's @CAPS22 we're going to do. You,"" I pointed to @PERSON3, ""@CAPS7 and sit over there."" @PERSON3 walked out of my room and sat down. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS9. @CAPS14 can't you two just relax and enjoy this time and act like you two are friends? For at least another six hours?"" I looked at each of them, @CAPS29 nodded in response. ""@CAPS9, @CAPS14 lets @CAPS7 finish the rest of this movie, or play a nice quiet game."" I sighed, hoping the worst was over. @PERSON3 walked back into my room, and laid on my bed, we continued through the movie peacefully. ""@CAPS10't @CAPS11 @CAPS12 just a comical genius?"" @PERSON2 said starring at the screen. We started laughing at @CAPS28 because @CAPS28 eyes seemed to be stuck on only him. ""@CAPS1 my gosh @PERSON2!"" @PERSON3 said laughing. ""@CAPS14 who's calling who crazy?"" @CAPS15 and @PERSON1 both looked at each other and started nervously chuckling. The tension in the air was almost to thick. @PERSON2 had on @CAPS28 game face for that comment.  I leaned over to @PERSON1 and whispered, ""@CAPS1 this is not going to be pretty."" We started preparing for the worst. ""@CAPS17 grab @PERSON3's arm and drag @CAPS28 if you have to, out of this room."" @PERSON1 jumped to @CAPS28 feet and got @PERSON3 out of the room, with just enough time for @CAPS15 to pin @LOCATION1 to my bed. When @CAPS29 had left and the door was closed I let @CAPS28 up but kept myself between @CAPS28 and the door. ""@CAPS4, @CAPS22 is going on with you two?"" I nervously asked @CAPS28.  @PERSON2 started to laugh a sort of villainous cackle that sent chills running down my spine. I couldn't help but give out a scared sounding chuckle, that only influenced the situation more. This could only mean one thing, my original intent, to not invite one of them, had just been confirmed, we were in for it. I slowly started backing away and headed out of my room to see @CAPS22 @PERSON3 had to say, since I never actually got anything out of @LOCATION1. I inhaled and headed down the hall to them. ""@CAPS4 @CAPS22's going on? You two haven't ever had this big of a fight before."" @CAPS20 started flowing down @CAPS28 cheeks, like a stream flowing steadily down a hill.  ""I...I don't know @CAPS22 h..happened."" @PERSON3 said still weeping. ""I j..just wanted to a..ask @CAPS28 @CAPS22 ha..happened today."" @CAPS21 and @PERSON1's faces just had that looked of, @CAPS22 happened that we missed.  ""@CAPS22 did you mean when you said @CAPS22 happened today?"" I asked. I was at a loss of words when she gave @CAPS15 @CAPS28 response. ""@CAPS23 that's all that happened? You two were going to rip each others hair out over a guy?"" @PERSON3 looked at @CAPS15 and simply said yes. ""@CAPS4 come in @CAPS3."" All three of us walked inside. I sat on the bed next to @LOCATION1, @PERSON1 was in the middle protecting @PERSON3. ""@CAPS4, this is pointless. @CAPS23 you both like the same guy. Big deal get over it! @CAPS29 just make things more complicated anyway."" I looked to both of them, @CAPS20 streaming down both their rosie cheeks. ""@CAPS14 can we just forgive and forget?"" @CAPS27 filled the room. @PERSON3 crawled over, the metal frame of the bed squeaking as she did. ""I'm @CAPS23 sorry, @PERSON2. Can you forgive @CAPS15?"" @CAPS28 face tear stained and red eyed, @PERSON2 was @CAPS17 to reply. ""Of course I forgive you."" @CAPS29 hugged with @CAPS20 still streaming down their faces. All was well again."	40
21064	"@PERSON1 of laughter     Once upon a time there once lived a girl named @PERSON1. The year was two thousand and fourty eight and there were only a few people that were alive after @DATE1, thats @CAPS7 the world ended. @PERSON1's friend @PERSON2 was a huge @CAPS1 freak. She would, by herself, make funny vidoes and put them on @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. One day she was so bored that she went and sat in front of her computer camera and made an "I'm a @ORGANIZATION1" video. It was the funniest thing @PERSON1 had ever seen. She was wearing a a @ORGANIZATION1 hat that was part of the @CAPS1 uniform, and was wearing a @CAPS1 shirt with some of the known characters. @PERSON2 was singing, "I'm a @ORGANIZATION1. I'm a little @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. I'm slitherin' slitherin' in the garden, snatching me up a mouse, a mousey mouse. I'm going to move my tongue to taste you." @CAPS7 she was finished she posted it on the web site. @PERSON1 showed all her friends what an epic faliure that video was, @PERSON2 of course loved it and so did @PERSON1.      Once the video wasnt that cool or funny anymore, which that took about two point five days, no one really watched it and no one really laughed about it, which it was made for that purpose. But @CAPS7 someone would watch it for the first time they would go to school, laugh their butts off and feel like an idiot because everybody had already watched it, and they didnt think it was funny anymore. So from then on people called this kid all sorts of names, but the one that really stuck was @ORGANIZATION1. Eeveryone in @LOCATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2's friend group all laughed and @CAPS7 @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 didnt laugh, their friends would call them losers because they weren't laughing at the kid who was getting teased. Laughing @CAPS7 someone is being teased isn't funny. The reason why people laugh and put down others is because they are insecure about themselves and it's not a laughing matter.       @CAPS7 people watch the video of @PERSON2 saying she was a @ORGANIZATION1, that was made to make people laugh and to think was funny, @CAPS8 didn't make the rude words people say to be used to put others down.      Laughing is a key thing to a conversation but also it's healthy for people to laugh. @CAPS7 others see that people are getting made fun of, it's not a time to laugh at them, it @MONTH1 be funny in some case but, put yourself in that persons shoes, feel what they are feeling @CAPS7 people say rude and hurtful things, people could stop the people who are throwing out put downs and stand for the ones who are getting their feelings hurt. Laughing was made for things that are actually funny. Say you walk down the street, on a sidewalk, and you walk by these punk kids who think they are the bown diggity, and they are poking sticks and throwing bottles and trash on at a homeless man with his dog, while the man is on the ground in pain from thses kids kicking him to where he cant move, are you just going to walk by and laugh because you think it's funny? No @CAPS2 not, @CAPS2 going to walk, or run, over to the poor man and see if he is oaky, then you maight call the police and see if they can find the kids who did this to this poor old man. See laughing at people who are down because of words or getting beat up isn't right and peeple need to stop, this is a world that if you are the last few people on the planet, and they have known about you laughing at others pain, do you really think that they are going to help you, or just walk by and laugh like you have? People are cruel in this world and we all need someone that is going to help us if we are hurt or down because of hurtful words.      One way you benefit from laughter, you feel good and you have people that will help you in the time of need, if you laugh about the right things. Tell @CAPS2 friends that if they laugh at peoples pain and anger, that one of these days no one is going to be there to stand up for them. You could be the change we have in schools, in work envirnment, in life in genral, be the change for @CAPS2 kids and grandkids, for @CAPS2 future friends, for the future world."	38
21070	" Laughter. Something everyone does. Its natural, organic, normal. They say children laugh more than adults, maybe that's @CAPS6 keeps them children. They can still let that deep instinct to enjoy themselves be expressed in bursts of happy noise. Laughter is always unique to every person. Some have musical laughs, others have deep belly laughs. Then there @CAPS10 those or snort or snicker, the kind of laugh that makes @CAPS8 laugh because @CAPS8 hear it. Those @CAPS10 my favorite. Someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"" and I couldn't agree more. Laughing with people has been the greatest influence in my relationships with my friends. I have five girlfriends that I would not be able to live without. They support me, love me, and get me to be bold and get out of my comfort zone. There have been many sleepovers where at two in the morning all @CAPS8 here is the laughter of all of us at some shocking @TIME1 confession or horror at the ""would @CAPS8 rather?"" someone just came up with. One @TIME1 in particular was especially funny. It was last @DATE1 and we were sleeping on @ORGANIZATION1's porch. It was a spectacular @TIME1, the stars were out the air was cool but comfortable and a meteor shower was happening later on that evening. @PERSON3 started the conversation with her favorite catch phrase, ""@CAPS1 guys, hows life?"" We all @CAPS16 because if @CAPS8 @CAPS10 around @PERSON3 for more than and hour @CAPS8 will here this saying a @CAPS2 times.  ""@CAPS3 as five minutes ago,"" I replied.  ""@CAPS4 guys my life has completely changed,"" said @PERSON1 sarcastically. ""@CAPS5 really?"" @LOCATION1 asked, her little body curled up in her sleeping bag, ""@CAPS6 have @CAPS8 had a personality flip, @CAPS11 @CAPS8'@CAPS20 now blond and stupid?""  ""@CAPS7."" @PERSON1 said sarcastically, rolling her eyes, a very @ORGANIZATION1 gesture. We @CAPS16 at the ridiculous mental picture of ""the brain""being stupid.  ""@CAPS8 guys want to play would @CAPS8 rather?"" @ORGANIZATION2 piped in. I had thought she was asleep by now. All I could see was her red hair covering her face. ""@CAPS9!"" yelled @PERSON2, ""I can't handle my mind being filled with horrible mental pictures!"" she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images. ""@CAPS10 @CAPS8 sure? I have some new ones."" @PERSON1 said with her best evil voice, ""@CAPS11 would @CAPS8 rather have to..."" ""@CAPS9!"" we all yelled together and the laughter ensued.  ""@CAPS13 or @CAPS14?"" @PERSON3 suggested. An unintelligible noise came from @ORGANIZATION2's pillow. ""@CAPS6 did @CAPS8 say?"" I asked. She raised her sleepy eyed face. ""I'@CAPS23 too lazy, and unless the @CAPS14 is to be the first one asleep then I'@CAPS23 not playing!"" she dropped her head back onto her pillow.  ""I agree,"" @LOCATION1 added, ""I'@CAPS23 too lazy.""  ""@LOCATION1 it would take @CAPS8 four hours just to get out off this porch cause @CAPS8'@CAPS20 so @CAPS21."" @CAPS16 @PERSON1. ""@PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 not @CAPS21. I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!""  ""@CAPS5 just accept it @LOCATION1, @CAPS8'@CAPS20 @CAPS21!"" ""@CAPS9 @PERSON1 I'@CAPS23 @CAPS17!""We continued @CAPS11 this, bantering back and forth till slowly people began to fall asleep, drifting off in the cool @TIME1 air. I was the last awake, and as I watched the meteor shower I had a sudden epiphany. My life was pretty awesome right now.  It was @DATE1, @CAPS9 school, @CAPS9 stress. I was laying on a porch watching a meteor shower listening the @TIME1 sounds and feeling perfectly safe, and I had the best five friends I could ever wish for. We joked and @CAPS16 with each other, but this is the first step to being so comfortable with people that @CAPS8 can tell them everything. Laughing with someone breaks the ice, it brings us closer together. Laying there I suddenly realized that because of all of our joking I felt comfortable enough with these girls to tell them just about everything, and I wanted to. I had never felt @CAPS11 this before. That I could do anything because there were five people that had my back through anything. I smiled to myself and as I closed my eyes I imagined all of the laughter I would get to enjoy with these friends."	40
21075	" Side by side with my best friend @PERSON1 we begin to walk to the park. The rained on @DATE1 @TIME1 wasn't very pretty or warm but the pleasures of watching lost and the hopeless at this particular park in @LOCATION1 was enough for us. Approaching the grass to the benches, mud was dominating my shoes when I was starting to think other wise of such fun. Sitting on the damp leaf filled benches we notice a man and his child walking toward us. Although this man was quite odd looking we quickly grew excited for what he had to say to us was more than likely going to match his appearance.  The fellow looked to be in his late thirty's with tight pants covered in what appeared as sharpie written all over him. A knitted scarf and with a small hat to match he had this flaming homely look about him. Beside him, a stroller with two small children, one at hand while the other lounging in a storage pocket below. The father we later find out, pretends his @NUM1 year old daughter is whispering in his ear, shouting things like ""@CAPS1 WAS THAT""?! suggesting he hadn't heard her although we knew she hadn't said anything at all. ""@CAPS2 want me to ask the girls if they want any raisins, is that what @CAPS2 want""? odd enough we look the raisins bushing them between the cracks of the benches on the few times he looked away. @PERSON1 an I then look at each other when he starts ranting how beautiful and striking her eyes were. The laughter was watering out of our eyes and being under such pressure to redeem, it was wanting to burst out of us both. The man then take out his phone with a video of a country singer compare their faces toward one another.  Minutes into the video I look away since the phone was now in @LOCATION2's hands. I feel her nudging me from leaving her even just with my eyes and hadn't continued suffering with the ridiculous video. Looking up I see the father staring at her as if waiting for some kind of reaction. Back to @PERSON1 I notice how uncomfortable we all were including his kids and he hadn't even a clue. throughout this whole interaction I hadn't said more than @NUM1 words in between the silent laughter and looking always that I couldn't control. My persistent friend who also hates being impolite then hands over the phone with a smile on her face and cheeks of red. ""@CAPS2 really look just like her @CAPS2 know""? All these questions he had for us and no answers but laughter prancing inside us. The boiling silence was rising between us and very little we could handle next. Pulling out a script the man then asks to see our acting skills and would like to direct us sometime. Once he spilled those beans on us we jolted directly toward her house while pouring out our enormous amount of laughs being held in and effecting our ability to talk. breathe by breath running I could finally speak causing me to blurt how i could hardly fathom the reality of his request. Just another day in @LOCATION1 we thought, but for us everyday was just something to laugh about."	35
21081	"@CAPS1 up kids my mother said as she was scrambling to get her stuff packed and ready.I knew exactly what i did wrong, I didn't set my alarm on my phone for six am. I set it for six pm and now we are late. Thinking to my self I hurried to get my clothes packed for the week. six pairs of pants, six pairs of shirts, six pairs of underwear, and six pairs of socks. I put my bag next to the front door realizing now that it was next to my other bag I had already packed the day before. My sisters were worse, as girls they take for ever putting on there makeup and and straightening their hair.Finally everyone is packed, but it was now seven am and we were supposed to be to @LOCATION2 by now and were still sitting here at our house. As my sisters are now done and we are in the car we can finally get off to @LOCATION3. We as a family have been planning @CAPS2 for a month and now it's @DATE2! I was really exited to go. By @CAPS2 point I had butterfly's in my stomach.We lived in @LOCATION1, we were only half way through @LOCATION2 with eight out of ten hours left to get to my mom's cousins house. I feel asleep for the first two hours of the ride and I can no longer sleep. I was stuck in the back seat with nothing to do. so I started to sing the never ending song. "@CAPS2 is the song that never ends, and it goes on and on my friends." @CAPS3 my sister in the front seat yelled at me very harshly to shut up. I didn't stop and she yet again yelled at me to stop singing. For a third time I annoyed my sister and she responded with a punch on my arm. For some reason I started to laugh. It didn't hurt and I thought it was funny that she hit me for just singing a silly song.I had a really strange laugh so my little sister started to laugh because I was laughing, then my older sister quite harshly screamed at me and my younger sister to be quite. My older sister yet again punched me trying to get me to stop laughing. By now I was laughing so hard I could hardly breath and my face was turning into a shade of purple. It really was funny when my mom couldn't hold it back any longer and started cracking up and laughing with me and my younger sister. My mom wears dentures, and she was laughing so hard they almost fell out of her mouth while she was driving, we started laughing harder. My stomach felt like it was going to explode from all the laughter.My older sister now turning a dark shade of blue from yelling at us so hard to get us to shut up. She was throwing her arms into the air and screaming one last time to shut up and threw herself back into her seat with a very nasty look of disgust on her face.over the next minute we all stopped laughing and was quiet for the next hour @CAPS3 we stopped and ate. We enjoyed our lunch and got on the road because we still had a long trip on our hands.I very soon felt tired and fell asleep in the most awkward of positions you could ever find in a car. I had my head against the door, my arm over the front passenger seat, one of my legs was on the seat and the other in between the driver and passenger seats.I thought I was pretty lucky sleeping most of the way for we only now had about a half hour till we got to my mom's cousins house. We were in the middle west of @LOCATION3 and the mountains were so beautiful. They were full of color and life with gigantic trees swinging in the wind, squirrels moving about from tree to tree, planting nuts in the ground. It was the farthest I have ever been away from where I lived in @LOCATION1. I was glad it was with my family.My stay in @LOCATION3 was a blur. I can hardly remember most of what happened there. I played with a neighbor kid around the same age as me playing video games and eating unhealthy junk food. My mom was the happiest of us all to get out of @LOCATION1 for a weekend. She had not seen her cousin in about three years and was very happy to see her.It was now @DATE1 was time to get back to our normal lives, so we packed up our stuff and were headed back to our home. I was doing amazing at not talking and making my sister mad for the first minute or so. @CAPS3 I started to sing the never ending song again. I have never laughed so hard in my life. "	36
21089	" After a long day at the @ORGANIZATION1 mom said it was my turn to decide where we went to dinner that night. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 because I love their seafood. We got @CAPS6 legs, popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp. After the food we got two slices of double chocolate lava cake. For some reason it sent us into a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard, we started to cry. We had just finished going clothes shopping at the @ORGANIZATION1 and mom said that I could pick where we went out to eat. My brother started whining about it but mom said it was fair because he got to choose last time. I chose @CAPS1 @CAPS2 which is what my brother said he would have picked anyway. I picked that restaurant for two reasons, first because it was close to the @ORGANIZATION1, and second because I love seafood. Mom didn't have a lot of money so she said we should all share a few things instead for everybody getting their own. We bought two pounds @CAPS5 @CAPS6 legs, and order of popcorn shrimp, and coconut battered shrimp (mainly for herself). I'm kind of glad we all shared because it was cheaper and it was just the right amount of food so we didn't have to take home boxes. We never eat leftovers anyway. After our dinner my brother and I begged our mother to buy a dessert. after much thought and convincing she said alright and ordered two slices of the best cake I've ever tasted in my entire life!It was so rich my mom and I could barley finish our slice. My brother gulped his down with ease. After we were done the waiter came by and replaced our plates with the tab.  We all glanced at it and decided not to get dessert again(which never actually happened). Then mom got a bad case of the giggles. Shortly after my brother and i caught the giggles like a disease. Giggles turned into laughter and the laughter became hysterical. We couldn't seem to figure out what was so funny or how it happened. People were starting to stare at us but we still couldn't contain ourselves. Pretty soon our eyes started to water and then there were tears. Tears of joy I'd assume but I new one thing for sure, we had to get out of there. Mom managed to pay the tab just fine, but as soon as she got in the car and herd me and my brother laughing, she started busting up again! She was absolutely convinced it was the cake. she said there is no other reasonable explanation that we would laugh and laugh about nothing. Now I believe that statement because we've tried every other dessert and none of them had the same effect on us. We go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh. I guess its not just the seafood that I like. I rather enjoy the cake too. We call it the double chocolate laugh cake."	36
21094	" Everybody knows that long car rides can be both physically, and mentally exhausting. Picture a family of four : a mother, a father, and two daughters in @CAPS1. The father is behind the wheel, the mother is in the passenger seat, the older sister is on the left side of the back seat, and the younger sister on the right side. The sun is rising, and you're still on the road. The father is tired, after driving all night. The mother just woke up, yawning, and is wondering how much further until the destination. The sisters are looking out of their windows with extremely bored expressions. Even with cups of coffee, and loud music the atmosphere is still lifeless, extremely dull. What could possibly bring up this lifeless atmosphere? My guess, a form of entertainment. As a young child, I was always on the road. Moving from place to place, because of my father's work. At the time, we were living in a state known for it's snow. @ORGANIZATION1. Wonderful wildlife, breathtaking views, and beautiful landscapes, untouched by man. During the long winter months, the snow covered the ground, like a blanket on a bed. You could wake up in the morning with two new feet of snow. Although, despite living in a cold, isolated state, the summers were extremely hot. A total twist to someone unfamiliar with @ORGANIZATION1's weather. This was around a decade ago, so the enviroment might've changed, but nevertheless, it is still a breathtaking, beautiful state. After coming home from school on a cool @DATE1 day, my mother told me to start packing my room. I knew we were due to leave that @DATE1, but I was still hesitant on leaving my friends. Every time that we moved, I had to say a heart breaking goodbye to the friends I knew for the few years I lived there. I went to my room and started to pack for a long, long trip. My father came to me and told me we are moving by car. He asked my sister and I to go with him so he could pick up the uHaul. We went to check out the sizes, and the condition it was in. As usual, the trucks weren't in the best of condition for moving over a long distance, but it's better than nothing. My father drove it back home, with my sister and I, and my father started to put the packed boxes in the truck. My mother, my sister and I finished packing the rest of the boxes. The boxes with valuable, and mandatory items were stuffed in my mom's @CAPS1, along with our cats in their cages. After getting everything packed, and loaded, the hired uHaul employees drove the uHaul away to our new destination, @LOCATION2. Everyone had mixed emotions about leaving. My mother loved her neighbours, my father had some amazing coworkers, my sister and I made some spectaular friends, but we had to say our goodbyes to our friends. It's not the first time, and it's not the last time, but every time it still hurts. The times we spent together, will always being in our memories! Off we go! To our new temporary home. Driving from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2. The only thing that I didn't like, was that we had to be in @LOCATION2 in less than a week. A week to drive that long way? Less stops, more driving, and no fun, or sight seeing... a total drag!! It was really chatty and energetic in the beginning, but everyone soon got sick of being on the road. My sister's body didn't handle it well in the beginning, and neither did mine. Half way to @LOCATION2, all conversations stopped. The atmosphere started to fade, and so did the excitement. There was absolutely nothing to do in such a small area. I wanted to try to make the rest of the drive fun, so I started to sing in my tone deaf way. Since I was so young, my voice cracked midway through the song we were listening to, which caused in uproar of laughter! My mother started to say that I was simply adorable, and my father started to mock me. My sister started to sing, too, and before you knew it, everyone was singing along! Spirits were high, and everyone was having fun singing, and laughing. We started being more active after that, too! The rest of the trip down south was full of energy, and both time and distance passed quickly. It's always fun to spend time with family, but it'll be even better if you spend the time in a fun, exciting way! Make things fun, keep a positive, enjoyable outlook on everything!"	40
21099	" My best friend @PERSON2 and I have a tradition that we made up. Every time she comes over to my house we always slide down the stairs in a sleeping bag. We came up with @TIME1 @CAPS4 she was spending the @TIME1 at my house. While sitting on the staircase with nothing to do it suddenly hit me. I turned to @PERSON2 and said""@CAPS1 could two little girls possibly do to have fun in the middle of the @TIME1, @CAPS4 all they have to work with is a long staircase that has been sitting right under their noses the whole time?"" and to @TIME1 she says ""I'm listening."" @CAPS2 we were both getting excited because we finally found something fun to do.I said ""I'll show you. We just need to get all the pillows we can find."" The two of us scampered around the house looking in every room and brought all the pillows we could find back to the staircase.""@CAPS3 @CAPS1 do we need all these pillows for?"" @PERSON2 asked and was surprised @CAPS4 i said ""for padding."" @CAPS4 the pillows were set up at the foot of the stairs, I told her of my brilliant plan. She loved it! We couldn't wait to get started. ""@CAPS5 purple sleeping bag will be perfect for @TIME1"" said @PERSON2.  I ran down the hallway to my room, snatched my sleeping bag, and sprinted back towards the staircase. My purple sleeping bag is super slick and was just the thing we needed to glide down the stairs.  @CAPS2, @DATE1, we are fourteen and fifteen @DATE1 old, we still have fun doing @TIME1. Over the @DATE1 we have improved it, making it nerve racking and loads more fun. @PERSON2 and I have agreed on some safety precautions, which we thought were necessary. @CAPS4 we are just using the sleeping bag we don't need them, but as we have added on to that we have agreed to wear a helmet and sometimes add a few pillows. The helmet kind of scares my mom because it's even needed. One @TIME1, while my parents were out, @PERSON2 and I had been eating way too much sugar and were extremely hyper. The two of us were sliding down the stairs but it was starting to get too easy,and wasn't as much fun as it was @CAPS4 we were about @DATE1 @DATE1 old. We wanted to make it even bigger and better than ever before! We started brainstorming. My brothers room was upstairs and we somehow wanted to incorporate his mattress into our fun. @PERSON2 and I dragged the mattress out onto the staircase. We both sat down on the mattress, pushed off, and went shooting down the stairs. We could barely keep a hold of the mattress. The farther we went down the staircase, the farther we slid off of the mattress. We were laughing @CAPS3 hard @CAPS4 we got to the bottom, we almost slammed into the wall! It was @CAPS3 much fun. After that first ride we decided we had better put an extra pillow up on the wall somehow. One thing we hadn't thought about before we went crashing down the stairs, was how heavy the mattress was. It was very hard to get back up the stairs, but we didn't mind because we were having @CAPS3 much fun.  @PERSON2 and I were getting tired @CAPS3 we decided to take a break. The two of us hauled the mattress up the stairs , it one last time before plopping down on the couch in the opposite room. Not too long ago my mom had bought an inflatable exercise bean. Shaped just like a real bean and had handles on both sides. @PERSON2 started messing around with it, and @CAPS4 she said ""@CAPS6 try it?""We both rushed back to the stairs, ready to have some more of the reckless fun that we love. Our imaginations were bouncing off the walls. @TIME1 time the two of us felt it was time to mix everything together for the ultimate ride. We kept the mattress on the top of the stairs and measured out just where we needed my sleeping bag to be. Our idea was to be sitting on the exercise bean, on top of the mattress, slide down off the mattress, land on the sleeping bag waiting on the stairs to give us a turbo boost, and finally be sent flying into the pillows at the bottom of the staircase. I found some duct tape @CAPS3 the @PERSON2 could tape the sleeping bag to the floor.  @PERSON2 let me go first. I was nervous because we'd never done @TIME1 before. After a minute a finally pushed off. It was a bigger drop from the mattress to the stairs than I thought it would be. @CAPS4 I landed on the sleeping bag it was like being inside of the @PERSON1 video game, and hitting the turbo boost. It was scary but @CAPS4 I got to the bottom the two of us were laughing uncontrollably. We had @CAPS3 much fun.   "	40
21106	"Water @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 we think that laughter is just an emotion, but in all actuality it's practically a way of life. We use laughter to cheer people up, or get out of trouble. People do stupid things just to make others laugh. I personally think laughter is a reason to live, and that every one needs more of it in their daily lives. I have always been the type to make every one laugh and feel better, and I would always put myself in pain just to cheer someone else up. When I was a child my friend would always be picked on at school, for no reason really. And I wasn't the type to take action, or try and get back at someone. But that all changed when my friend came home covered with food crying before school was even let out. She told me that these girls threw their lunches at her and were calling her names. So the next day I went to school with her in the morning and I took @CAPS1 filled with chocolate milk, smoothie, egg yolks and soured milk. When she pointed the girls out to me I grabbed the balloon with chocolate milk and threw it right at one of them and it hit her in the chest. She started screaming that her clothes were designer, like someone would actually care. I looked at my friends face, she was awe shock, but I could tell she was trying to hold back her joy because she knew I was not yet finished. I then threw one with egg yolks in it and got in a girls hair, her scream was earsplitting. The smoothie filled one got two of the girls who were hugging to try and keep each other safe (or trying to use each other as a shield) but it wouldn't work with my throws. They started to freak out and run to the others, which was a bad idea because they were all hudled together trying to figure out who it was. By the time they figured it out it was too late, I was already throwing the biggest balloon filled with soured milk at them and they couldn't get out of there fast enough. It landed in between all of them and exploded when they had turned to see what it was that was thrown. It covered all of them and they started screaming so loud that the school officials started coming out of the building to see what all the screaming was about.  I could see everyone of the kids who saw the whole show coming over to me, they started to tell me how amazing it was and how funny the girl's reactions were. Some kids were still on the ground laughing so hard they couldn't breathe. Some thanked me and told me that these girls had been picking on them for a while. I looked at my friend who was on the verge of tears. She ran over and hugged me so tightly I thought the air was going to be squeezed out of me. It's been ten years since then and I still talk to my friend, she even occasionally calls me if she's having trouble with someone at school. As for the girls? I haven't heard anything about them since they all got transferred to different schools. I guess laughter is the source of all joy in our lives, and helps people become closer then ever before. My friend still says that it was the best day of her life. Some of the other kids who witnessed the event go to high school with her now, and all ask how I am and want to see me do something like it again. Unfortunately I had to turn them down and tell them they have to learn how to deal with their own bullies themselves. I imagine that some of them have come up with very creative ways to get back at people by going off of what I did."	40
21112	" Laughter plays a huge part in my life, my family loves to laugh. We are always making each other and people around us laugh. @CAPS8 you put two or more @CAPS1's together someone is going to start cracking up. Sometimes the kids in my family have games to make each other start @CAPS4.  There is this one @CAPS2 that a couple of us play; no one ever oficaly gave it a name so we just call it theLaughing @CAPS2. The @CAPS2 starts out with one person standing in froung of everone else thats playing. The goal of the @CAPS2 is to try to get one of the other people to start @CAPS4, and the first one to laugh has to trade places with them to do the same thing. We really dont play that often just @CAPS8 their'se nothing else to do. One night my two nefues and I were just siting around looking for something to do @CAPS8 my little nefue @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 play the @CAPS4 @CAPS2"". His older brother @PERSON1 and I didnt really want to play but there was nothing else to do so we bouth said that we would. It started out like it always did nobody really wanted to go first, but @CAPS7 sombody finly maned up and just went. @CAPS7 it got started. After that everbody was @CAPS4 and having a good time. It went on like this for a while, but after about a houre or so it started to get boaring. @PERSON1 and I were strating to get board out of our minds so we were going to ouit, but my little nefue didnt want us to. @PERSON2 went up to take a turn. @CAPS8 @PERSON2 went up for his turn, he started out like he usually did just making stupid faces and funny sounds to try to get people to laugh. We had seen all of his faces and herd all of his noises so it wasnt going to work. @CAPS7 after he realised that we wernt going to laugh he started telling us a story. He started the story out by saying ""@CAPS6 this guy right; he didnt have anything besides his chair and his box. He loved his chair and his box."" The story wasnt very funny yet but he went with it. ""@CAPS7 the guy went to bed because he was tired and all, and @CAPS8 he woke up his stuff was gone. His chair and his box the only two things that he had in this world were gone. So he went looking for his things. He was searching all day and night but he couldnt find anything not his chair, his box, or even a clue of where they could have gone. So he disides to go to bed and maybe they would be back in the morning like maybe it was all a dream; but @CAPS8 he woke up he had turned into a wild boar."" @CAPS8 he said that @PERSON2 started running around acting like a pig. That got us @CAPS4 but he didnt want to stop there he just kept telling his story. In the story it turnd out that everytime the ""guy"" went to bed something strange would change and it just got more and more funny. My family loves to laugh and have others laugh with us. Just like my nefue @PERSON2 he didnt want to stop telling his story because he had us cracking up. Weather were just hanging out and telling a couple of joaks or making up a @CAPS2 we love to laugh. Lauchter has a huge part in my life."	35
21118	" From birth to young adulthood, kids are raised by their guardians or parents. It is the parent's responsibility to convey to their children good morals, life skills, and to teach them how to cope and thrive in society. @CAPS24 parenting children requires being firm and strictly reinforcing rules. The result of this however, is the child leaves their parents prepared to live their adult lives outside the home.It is safe to say that although I am a still a teenager, I have learned quite a lot about raising kids. My knowledge mostly being based off of stories passed down to me by my parents and grandparents about their life lessons. Being ""in on"" these small, yet significant bits of history is quite enjoyable for me. I'd have to say that although many of the facts about the ""good old days"" are great, it is the almost tangible memories which my family connects with laughter that are the most significant to me. My @CAPS1 grew up in the @DATE1's living in a small yet average sized house with her @CAPS1, @CAPS3, and four brothers and sisters. The main subject which is the focus of the stories my @CAPS1 retells about her childhood come from memories made at the dinner table. It was her @CAPS5's (my @CAPS6's) goal, for his children to learn proper manners and standard etiquette. It was expected of the @PERSON3 children to practice this by being calm, courteous, and mindful of their physical actions when gathered around the table for dinner. For an average, fun, causal, and not so dignified @CAPS7 family, that was a lot to ask. Throughout their childhood my @CAPS1 and her siblings tried their very best to behave and do as they were told at the dinner table. The only common occurrence that was particularly displeasing to my @CAPS6 was when someone spilled their milk. This fateful event happened almost every night. When milk was spilled it was either the cause of a child engaging in funny business, or it was a result of reaching to far to retrieve the butter dish. Whatever the reason, it was somehow hysterically funny when this occurred. The only catch was, that laughing at the table was frowned upon for it seemed to break the formal mood the family strove for during the evening meal. Laughing and spilling milk were two actions not encouraged at the dinner table. Spilling milk did not continue to happen as often as the children grew up, but that is not to say that is discontinued it's presence at the dinner table completely. One night it was not my @CAPS1 nor any of her siblings that spilled their milk. Instead, it was my @CAPS6. When the initial incident occurred, the whole family was in a state of shock. In effort to clean up the mess everyone donated their napkin, while their @CAPS3 maintained a controlled but disgruntled demeanor. When all was cleaned up, the family went on with their meal and on my @CAPS6's face was a subtle yet unmistakable grin. Years later my @CAPS1 (@PERSON4), @PERSON1, @CAPS15 @CAPS16, @PERSON2, and @PERSON2 @CAPS17 grew up, got married, and some even began families of their own. Most of my @CAPS1's family lives in @LOCATION2 so they enjoyed coming up to visit their @CAPS1 and @CAPS3 (my @CAPS21 and @CAPS6) at the holidays or whenever they were able. During these times when the entire family is able to gather here in @LOCATION1, there is hardly ever a somber or serious moment at the dinner table. As my @CAPS3 would say, ""@CAPS24 we laugh so hard that tears run down our legs.""  I attribute to the fun we have together to this bond of love that connects us all, and I feel it would not be as prominent without the element of laughter. I feel that my @CAPS6 (who is now in heaven with @CAPS21), accomplished the goal of preparing his children for life. Now that they are all grown up, they can let loose, enjoy each others company, and feel free to bust out in laughter even if there is a risk of someone spilling their milk."	48
21126	"When my friend @PERSON2 and I went to go hang out with our friends from @LOCATION1. We knew how would get there but we didn't know how we were going to get back, but knowing us we didn't care we just wanted to have fun. we had lot's of fun hanging out but then it started getting dark we needed a ride back home. Later on I decited to call my dad to see if he would come and get us. Knowing my dad he thought it was really funny that my friend and I were stuck in @LOCATION1, so he started laughing. After he was still laughing I asked so can you come get us cause its getting ready dark and he said no, cause it's not his fault that I was stuck there. So @PERSON2 said ""why don't I call my dad to see if he would"" and so she did but just like my dad he also started laughing and said no. Later on @PERSON2 and I ran out of people who to call. So we said to each other why don't we worry about his later it's really not that dark and we can all still hang out for a while longer. After i thought that throw I knew we should start worry about because later on it well get even more darker then it already is and then we diffidently wont have a ride home. So I told @PERSON2 that we should keep on trying people while we hang out with our friends more, but she didn't care so much. I made a call to my sister @PERSON1 to see if she would do me the favor of picking us up from @LOCATION1. I called and call her but she wouldn't pick up her phone. An hour past and we still couldn't think of someone, but then I thought to my self maybe my other sister @CAPS1 she always does favors for me, I called her and I asked her if she could and she said yes ill be there in @NUM1 minuets to pick you guys up. So I went to go tell @PERSON2 the great news that I got us a ride home and we don't have to worry about it anymore. When I went back to the park she wasn't there any more I thought she went to the bathroom, so I went to checked the bathroom for her but she was not there also. I thought to my self where could she of gone. I started to get really worried about were she went so I walked around and looked for her. So I looked at my clock and saw that my sister was going to be here in ten minuet, before I realized she was at the store getting food and she didn't tell me. I got really mad at her for not telling me where she went, but I thought to myself it didn't matter so why was I going to make a big deal about it and then I heard someone beep and it was my sister @CAPS1 I got really happy to see her cause all I thought of is going home and sleeping all night and all day. We got in the car and my sister asked why didn't I call my dad for a ride? I told her I did but he didn't want to pick me up because if I could get here then why couldn't get back home. She started laughing at me and thought it was the most funniest thing my dad has ever done. After we dropped of my friend @PERSON2, we went out to eat to burger king and got two salads to go. When I got home my dad asked who brought me and I told him my sister went and got me and took me out to eat. After being stuck in @LOCATION1 so long and not having a way to get I just went to my room and went to bed because it was a very long day for me and my pore little feet. The next morning I didn't wake up until @NUM2 in the @TIME1. My dad thought i need to wake up already so he went it my room and woke me up and told me i need to eat and get fresh air. I woke up and took a shower and eat some food and took a very short walk because my feet were still hurting from yesterday. when I went on my walk I was thinking about how I shouldn't of just gone to @LOCATION1 with out making sure I had a ride back home, but I was very thankful for my sister going out of her way to pick me up and not get mad or even yelled at me. when I got back home I called my sister and told her that I was really thankful for her going to go get me and my friend and even taking me out to eat."	27
21132	" Laughter is what connects me @PERSON1 my friends. It's a very important aspect in any kind of relatioship. I know that almost all the memories I have are of my friends making me laugh, @PERSON1 we have been friends for a very long time. One of my favorite funny memories is the time me @PERSON1 two of my friends went to @LOCATION1 @PERSON1 stopped at @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2... We sort of had a hard time getting out. Me @PERSON1 my friends, @PERSON1, went to @LOCATION1 to do a cultural performance at @ORGANIZATION1. When we were done we started heading back home. @PERSON1 kept complaining about needing to use a restroom. Her dad told her to wait until we got to @LOCATION2 so we could stop somewhere. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I suggested @ORGANIZATION2. By the time we got to @ORGANIZATION2 was doint the potty dance. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 I got in line to order ice cream cones dipped in chocolate. While we were waiting @PERSON1 was searching for the restroom. After approximately four minutes of searching, @PERSON1 finally asked the lady working behind the counter where the bathroom was. She handed @PERSON1 a key with a large bulky wreath attached to it @PERSON1 told her it was outside behind the building. @PERSON1 took the key @PERSON1 sprinted to what appeared to be double dorrs. Little did @PERSON1 know that only the left door opens. She ran straight into the right door @PERSON1 fell over. we all started cracking up laughing... Especially @PERSON1. She laughed so hard that she didn't quite make it to the restroom. Instead she had an ""accident"" on the floor in @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2. When you can laugh with your friends about things that might not seem funny to other people, such as, wetting yourself in public, it only makes your friendship stronger. Laughing is a huge important benefit in any kind of relationship. It strengthens the relationships you already have @PERSON1 it helps build new ones also."	40
21137	" My best friend @PERSON2 turned thirteen on a beautiful @DATE1 day. Her family had a boat and, since it the weather was not quite uncomfortably hot but not so cold that it was chilly outside, @PERSON2 decided to have a sleepover birthday party on the deck with some of her closest freinds. I was nervous about meeting her school-going friends since I'd always been a homeschooler and wasn't going to know any of the other people there. When I arrived at the boat, @PERSON2 introduced me to her friends @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and @PERSON4. I greeted them all and @PERSON2 suggested we go @CAPS2. I was ready to walk down to the beach but @PERSON4 said she wanted to go @CAPS2 right on the docks. @CAPS2 by the boats wasn't allowed and I was certain @PERSON2 would say @CAPS1 immidiately but instead she walked over to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' sign, tore it down, and tossed it in the harbor. Her friends laughed and I laughed too. I'd never seen people act this way. But their disregard for rules and customs was contagious. As the day went by I watched the was they talked and behaved. The girls used bad language and spoke harshly. Everything they said was loud and shocking and everything they did was to be wild and challange authority. They acted so free but there was something about their interactions with each other that seemed forced. I wondered if they were truly this way or if they were just pretending. But I understood that to be part of them I had to act like them. It was my first expirience with peer pressure and I didn't know quite what to do. But the girls' attutudes were simple, so I adapted and started to behave like them. But it became clear to me that in order for there to be a group there has to be someone who wasn't in the group. That was @PERSON3. @PERSON2' parents had made her invite @PERSON3 and @PERSON4 and @PERSON1 knew it. They would sit close together so she didn't quite have room, they would look with disintrest at her without laughing when she tried to make a joke. I became aware that if I hadn't adapeted so quickly to the attitude of the girls, I might have been the one they left out. I also knew that they could still turn on me if I did something wrong. We were sitting on the deck of the boat talking about movies and @PERSON3 was trying to tell the group about one that she'd just seen and was now her favorite. @PERSON1 stared blankly at her, refusing to smile. @PERSON4 looked off into space. @PERSON2 rolled her eyes to me. Sudenly, @PERSON1 cut @PERSON3 off and started talking about a scary movie she'd just seen. @PERSON3's eyes widened, then she looked down at the ground. Without thinking, I laughed and reached out to her arm, telling her I wanted to hear more about the movie. I'll never forget the way she lit up at that simple kindness. She smiled and began to gush about how amazing it was with renewed enthusuasm. @PERSON1 condinuted her story while watching @PERSON3 and me. @TIME1, when we went to the movie theater and the girls chose to sit in a row that only had room for four, I moved to sit with @PERSON3 in the next row down. We talked about the absurdity of straws for drinks and how we would never, ever wear skinny jeans. It was easy to talk to her. I didn't have to run everything I said through my head to make sure it wouldn't make anyone dislike me. Even @TIME1 when we were back at the boat, I tried to behave in the same way. I'd never had to focus on being myself before but I knew if I could do it, @PERSON3 would have someone to talk to. To my surprise, everyone became more natural. Soon we were all joking about what ridiculous things @PERSON2 should wish for with her birthday wish. I suggested a lifetime supply of marshmellows. @PERSON4 suggested the original @CAPS3 of @CAPS4. @PERSON3 suggested to wish that everyone in america would speak with a @CAPS5 accent on @PERSON2' birthday from now on. Everyone laughed. I saw that day that kindness if more powerful than crulty. Making someone an enemy or an outsider doesn't make a friendship stronger. Neither does having to worry about saying or doing something that might make your friends reject you. But integrity and kindness can bring people closer."	39
21143	" Laughter is the key to every friendship I have. If a person is really nice, but I cannot seem to make them laugh, or vice versa, it is hard to find common ground between us. When I see my friendships and reflect on them, it reminds me of all of the great memories over the years and months that were filled with joyous laughter. The simple things that make me happy in life bring about laughter. Whenever differences become clear in friendships, it only takes a memory brought up that made us laugh, to trigger that friendship back into place.  Whenever I'm with my best friend, @PERSON1, things that normally would not be funny whatsoever, are. Another element that's put in place is the fact that @PERSON1 and I don't hang out as often as we used to, when we went to the same school @DATE1 @DATE1. So, the absence of eachother makes us treasure our times together even more than usual. Three nights ago, I went to dinner with @PERSON1 and her mom at @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We had numerous amounts of laughing sessions throughout dinner. Everyone who is ever around us, either think we are very annoying because we cannot stop laughing, or understand what it's like to have a best friend that makes your @DATE2 brighter, and think we're funny. There has never been a true fight between @PERSON1 and I because of how close we've become over the @DATE1 and realized how much we are like twins. So conflicts are never really brought up. However, one of my other very close friends, @PERSON2, that goes to my previous school with @PERSON1, has been having problems with @PERSON1. The most important thing to me is that they get along, because they are two of the most important people in my life. I would do anything to make them become friends like they used to be, even though I probably don't have the power to do so. I can get close into both of their hearts and stay on a level of laughter, secrets and wonderful memories. But when they are not getting along with eachother, it's not so easy to bring them together. I had been with @PERSON2 @TIME1, so I knew what she was feeling as well as @PERSON1, who I was with currently. I tried to shortly bring up the subject and at first, she rejected it. I knew that @PERSON2 meant a lot to her, and also that they had only gotten in a small arguement over something silly. The issue was that both of them can be very stubborn, and in any type of arguement, neither will say they are sorry first. It's because they both don't believe they have done anything wrong. In this case, it was a small miscommunication. I ended up going into more detail with @PERSON1 about how @PERSON2 was feeling, because I could completely relate. She later started seeing the other side of things, once I got her laughing. The key to my friendships, is laughter. Especially while we are young. There is no way I could have gotten @PERSON1 to listen to my view on @PERSON2's feelings unless they were what she wanted to hear. So, I told her what she wanted to hear. Things that made her laugh and giggle. Things that brought back memories of the good times her, @PERSON2 and I had had. She thought about it, and even though she wasn't completely ready to full out run up to @PERSON2 and hug her over and over, and make peace, she was ready to consider communicating with @PERSON2 again. That was enough for me to feel good.   The rest of the @TIME2, we put aside the drama and laid back and enjoyed the @TIME2. We played our favorite songs and were cracking up the entire @TIME2 about the tiniest things, or mistakes we made in our speech when we talked to eachother. I know that as I get older, I will look back on my two best friends, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, and realize how they made my high school years so amazing. They brought a better person out of me, someone who can enjoy life to the fullest by being in the right crowd and having innocent fun. They taught me that you can be great friends with more than one person, and even if those two don't get along, you can find a balance and not end up excluding anyone. In the end, the important thing is that you were a good friend to everyone and weren't selfish in the mix. Laughter has brought me to that place. I find that when I'm laughing about sincerely great things, and not making fun of someone or something, I become a lot less selfish and a better friend to people, because my intent is beautiful. I wouldn't get that perspective without true friends that @CAPS3 has given me. By the @DATE2, @PERSON2 calls me and tells me that @PERSON1 called her and asked her to talk. Things will change very soon. "	40
21148	"                                   Laughter. Laughter is a key thing to have in a relationship. I once knew someone that had a great relationship becuse of laughter. They didnt think that they would still be together if they ddnt have any laughter in their relationship. Laughter is the shortest distance between each other because if you dont see this person, but you can sill laugh with this personand have a great relationship with that other person.  Laughter between these two people laughed all the time and they got closer then ever, even though they didnt see eachother all the time, everyday I knew that there relationship wouldnt be alive anymore if they didnt have there laughter, it means that you are happy with that person.  Laughing with somone that you care about also means that you can trust that person and you are being yourself around that person and you dont have to act how you would normally with someone else that you dont trust! I had a boyfriend that i could laugh with all day everyday and thats what kept our relationship together. We laughed instead of talking because that says how we feel towards each other, and we could just tell that we were happy with each other just by laughing. Sittin on the couch staring at each other in the eyes, then we just started to laugh because we thought of something that we had said that made us bust up and just to laugh like crazy even with out saying any words.  Even though we had our fights we would still laugh at eachother and things that made us laugh that one other said. I would be really upset and sad and he would would just know what to say to make me laugh, then i am happy because i know trhat he ares about me and cares if im happy or sad I am. A real relationship is very hard to find with a guy that can make you laugh when your really upset or mad by just smiling or saying somethings that is goofy. Even though he was mad at me he would still try to make me laugh or smile because thats what i relationship is about. If you cant smile or be happy with that person that you ""love"" then you shouldnt be with that person because you know that you wont be happy and you will always be depressed or just plan old mad at that person. Laughter is a key thing and its something that can bring your relationship closer in many ways. If you laugh with that person and you can be yourself that means that if you break up after if it didnt work then that is probably a good sign that you guys will be great friends after. I believe that laughter is something that makes two people closer and then it also is the shortest distance between two people, if you dont wanna talk like me and my boyfriend do we just sit or stand there and laugh because we knew that we could just laugh at eachother and im sure people that we were weird or something, but we didnt even care so we would just laugh and laugh all day everyday all night long. I think that if you arent even in a relationship and you guys or gals are just great friends like me and my friend @CAPS1 are then you can just laugh at everything that you think is funny and just have a great time, you dont have to be in a relationship with someone to laugh with someone. Laughing is great fort the soal."	35
21154	"Laughter is a key importance in life, family, and relationships. Gets people through tough times and times when you just need a friend. Laughing is a big part in my life, joking around and having fun, when something happens I try to cover it up with laughter. People @MONTH1 say that laughing is to much in situations, but it gets a lot a people trough tough times. @CAPS1 there was no laughter in the world in would be dull and I feel that people would be without really experience laughing and making jokes.    Making other people laugh gives me good feeling even @CAPS1 it is a lame joke. I think that because it gives me a good feeling about my self, one good thing I know how to do. My family has always been the joking type, messing around and just laughing about everything. There has been a lot of good memories with my family and I, jokes and what not. We enjoy every little laughing matter because its something we each treasure and its a bond that we do not want to loose.One moment in my life where laughter was really great for was in awkward situations with people. My sports team, getting down on ourselves very fast during games and we start to blame other people which is the most common thing that people do when they start to stress in situation like this. Causing so many errors my team mates and I are just not paying to one another and not acting like a team. Just after losing so many games you really start to lose hope for yourself and your team. Our coach always try's to comfort us by saying we did good or we could have tried harder. Some people take this seriously or people do not care and act nothing ever happened and those people start to shut @CAPS2 out and only care for their good friend on the team. One morning before we even started things were tense between people. The captain noticed that two of the team members where talking about her and she confronted them saying ""@CAPS1 your going to talk about me behind my back just say it to me."" @CAPS2 was in complete shock no one knew what to say, so i stated ""well this is just awkward."" The whole team just started to laugh because it loosened @CAPS2, even though it didn't totally solve things it just made the situation a little better.Another moment in my life where laughter was a key part was during road trips. Being suck in the car with my family going somewhere and on the way back from were ever we came back it is a lot of bonding time. You start to talk crazy not making an sense, not being like yourself. Then it bring out the fun of messing around then saying something or do something were it become really funny and its a moment that you don't want lost. An example that happened to me on this experience was going to @LOCATION1 and making up a lot of inside jokes of things we saw or heard. moments like these I always want to treasure because these people in your life right now will not always be their. To create memories do the basic thing and laugh with family. Laugh with your friends.I believe that in some of these situations it could help loosen some of the tension between people, and sometimes make things a little less weird between people. Just being yourself and dont change that. Having so many of these types of moments and much more are special to me, no matter good or bad. they help me remember things easier. Just having the little moments like these are special and it reminds me of how much I really did care about this one person or realize that a moment wasn't a total lost, because it had the thoughts of people laughing and its something that comforts me.

21159	" My cousin @PERSON1 and her boyfriend, @PERSON2, had been dating for three years and they had planned a special date for their anniversary. They made reservations at the @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1 and then take a walk on the beach after-wards. For @PERSON1 this was a small step up from an ordinary date but for @PERSON2 this was the biggest day of his life. This late @DATE2 evening was the day he would ask @PERSON1 to be his wife! @PERSON2 pulled up to @PERSON1's house at precisely five-o'clock pm. In his hands he held a bouquet of roses which were handed to the most beautiful girl on the @ORGANIZATION1. She was dressed in a white and pink dress with matching pink heels and her hair was all done up fancy. @PERSON2 was speechless as he handed her the bouquet. After the roses were placed in some water, he escorted her down the steps to his car, @CAPS1 number one. @PERSON2 couldn't start his car. In utter embarrassment @PERSON2 asked @PERSON1 to drive her car to dinner. She giggled and assured him that she didn't mind. When they arrived at @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 they were sad to find that their reservation had been double booked and the other couple had arrived only moments before them. In despair, they set off in search of something else. Everything else that @DATE1 @TIME1 seemed to be full so @PERSON1 decided on @CAPS2's, her favorite restaurant. After a good forty-five minutes of waiting to be seated they were lucky enough to get a window seat. @PERSON2 ordered a burger and fries because he is not a seafood fan. In contrary, @PERSON1 loves seafood so she had a bowl of @CAPS2's world famous clam chowder. When dinner was finished @PERSON2 excused himself to use the restroom before they left but as he was getting up, he knocked over his @ORGANIZATION3 and it spilled all over @PERSON1's new dress, creating a brown, sticky mess. @PERSON1 cleaned up the best she could but there was almost no use. So far so bad, but the worst was still yet to come. When they came to pay the bill @PERSON2 began panicking. He realized that he had left his wallet in his car! @PERSON2's face turned bright red as he watched his girlfriend pay the bill. Good thing we didn't go to the @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2! he thought. @PERSON1 was ready to go home but @PERSON2 was determined to propose to her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set. She agreed. With @CAPS6 step, @PERSON2's heart began to beat faster, his throat dry, his hands sweat, and his body shake. They sat on the warm sand and talked for ten minutes. Finally @PERSON1 was really ready to go so this was his last chance. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the lone ring. As he got on one knee, the ring fell into the sand. It was getting dark so after a minute or two of frantic searching, he gave up and began to cry. @PERSON1 was so confused and thought he was crying because she wanted to leave but as soon as @PERSON2 calmed himself he told his story and how this was supposed to be the perfect proposal for the perfect girl but it turned out the be the worst @TIME1 of his life. @PERSON1 just laughed which made @PERSON2 think she was mocking him but he continued anyway. ""@PERSON1, will you be my wife?"" @CAPS4 tears of joy she said, ""@CAPS5! As long as @CAPS6 day can be an adventure like tonight."" @CAPS6 time they mention this story they bust out laughing even though it wasn't funny at the time. Ever since then they have had many hilarious and embarrassing stories that they can laugh at now."	46
21166	"   The day was not a fun one. We all just heard really bad news. None of us were even close to smiling. None of us. Even the people that you always see smiling, they had the most serious look on they're face. it was just a bad day. But then one of our friends, @PERSON1, had a great idea of going online to find something to cheer us up. It truly was a amazing idea. We spent hours on the computer just sitting there looking up ridiculous videos that we knew about. Trying to make each other laugh. That's when our day started to be a bit better. But it went back down a bit when a few people left to go home. Only three of us were still at @LOCATION1's house. @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I were all sitting there watching @LOCATION2 when a show we all loved came on. Psych. It was a new episode too! what a great day it turned out to be. The show is full of really puny and dumb humor but it fit all three of us. @PERSON1 the most. We were all laughing and having a good time. @PERSON1 was laughing after the show was over. So we asked what was so funny. He just kept laughing. For five minuets he was laughing. when he finally stopped we asked again. What was so darn funny. then he told us. "" I was laughing at my own laugh. I sound really weird. "" that's when we all started laughing. how could he be laughing at his own laugh. we soon realized how hard it was to stop. it turned out to be a okay day after all of what happened. Now, when ever we are having a bad day. we just bring up that day where we laughed at our selves for ten minuets. And the day is all better."	31
21174	"                   Laughter is the Shortest Distance Between Two People A thing we have done since birth is laugh. Laughter is something incredible in the world of human existence, it is something that relieves awkward situations, brings people together, and makes life a little bit easier. Laughter is something that everyone shares in common. Some people find laughter in different things than others but still we can all laugh together. Many times in my life has laughter helped me through tough situations, brought me close to someone, and just made life more enjoyable.   I remember once I was trying out for a volleyball team. It was the first day of tryouts and I was really nervous because I didn't know anyone. I had never even heard of these people and now I was going to be competing against them. There was one thing I knew about them though. It was that we all shared a common goal of making the team and being successful. Tryouts began and I felt like they were wondering why I was even there, but I ignored them and just kept working hard. Tryouts went okay for the rest of the week but still something just didn't feel right. I still felt like I didn't belong there. It was the last day of tryouts and the girls had warmed up a little, but I still felt a little uncomfortable. After the last practice it was time to announce the teams. I was really nervous cause what if I didn't make it? Or what if I did, but everyone hated me on the team? He announced the names and I was beginning to give up hope when he said my name. I was so excited, but the girls seemed to be annoyed by my name getting called. When I got home I told my parents and they were excited for me. I then told them how I didn't really know anybody and kind of felt like an outsider. They asked me if I had tried talking to anyone, and I said no not really they didn't try talking to me so I thought why should I? My mom then told me that I could only get to know them if put myself out there. I thought about it and realized I really hadn't. I ignored them as much as they ignored me. I also wasn't myself, because I really am a cool person and I am fun to be around, I just for some reason I crawled into a shell this time. I decided the next day at practice I would put myself out there. The next practice I showed up and was partnered up with a girl named @PERSON1. It was so awkward and at first we were just quiet passing the ball back an forth. Then I started talking to her and making jokes she laughed and I laughed and we had a great time. The rest of the practice went great. The awkward moments faded away into laughter. We all worked hard and joked around with each other, laughed, and I really felt like we were bonding. They laughter had brought us together. All this time it felt like we were so far away and different and really it wasn't like that at all. Having fun and laughing together showed us how much we had in common and that we were all the same. I believe that day that laughter brought our team together.  I will never forget that day. It was the day I learned how important laughter was in a relationship, getting to know someone, and how well it brings people together. That season of volleyball I made many new friends. I also learned a valuable lesson that and awkward situation can always be turned around by laughter. Today I still talk to those girls on the team and still today we all laugh together, just because you known someone for a while doesn't mean the fun and laughter has to fade away, because I believe it should get stronger. Whenever I am meeting new people I always try to break the ice and lighten up the mood with something funny, because I think that a big point in our lives is to be happy, have fun, and all laugh togther. That is exactly what I plan to do."	42
21179	" When i think of a day where laughter was the element, i think of @DATE1. That was one of the worst days of my life. I had plans to break up with my girlfriend.  That morning, my decision was final, and i was going to do it. For some reason when i woke up, i felt sick. That day, everything was falling apart. Around @NUM1 @CAPS1, i went to my girlfriends house, and broke up with her. The next day, i couldn't smile to save my life. The whole day my friends were making me smile, and showing me they cared. The next day i felt so much better. I was smiling and laughing like nothing ever happened. All day my friends were telling me jokes, and being really stupid. They made me laugh so much.  Throughout those upcoming weeks, i met another girl. I couldn't be anymore positive about my life. All i do now is just smile and laugh. I don't need to live my life with sadness. All i can do is just be positive, and smile. Laughter is very important. No one should go a day without it. Just lets just lives our lives to the fullest, and put the past behind us. Just think on the bright side, and smile."	31
21185	"It's true @CAPS8 they say, time flies when you're having fun. On a particularly warm @DATE1 @TIME1, a rehearsal was in session for the wonderful production of ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2"" and I was bringing my best friend, @PERSON2 some cheap but delicious food. We talked and ate for a while but eventually it was time for me to go. @CAPS3 we were walking down the stairs to get to the back doors of the building I asked if they needed any help with the play. ""@CAPS3 a matter of fact we do!"" @CAPS7 said enthusiastically. ""We need a ladies costume @CAPS4.""I had absolutely no idea @CAPS8 that meant, but I felt that the position had potential. ""@CAPS5, I can do that. Just one question..."" I said a little confused.""@CAPS6?"" @CAPS7 replied, slightly amused.""@CAPS8 exactly am I going to @CAPS12 doing?"" I asked her.We changed course and headed for the costume room so that @CAPS7 could introduce me to, @PERSON1 who would @CAPS12 my boss for the next two weeks. We arrived to find that @CAPS7 had already gone home for the night. A little exasperated, @PERSON2 told me the basic idea of the job.""@CAPS9 basically @CAPS8's going to happen is that you are going to @CAPS12 in charge of the changing rooms and the costume changes on stage."" @CAPS7 said quickly.""@CAPS11 okay, I can do that."" I replied with confidence.@CAPS3 I began to talk to her more about @CAPS8 I would @CAPS12 doing @CAPS7 said that @CAPS7 had to go because break was over. ""@CAPS12 here at @NUM1 tomorrow morning and you'll learn everything you need!"" @CAPS7 said hurriedly.@CAPS3 @CAPS7 ran off into the theatre I could hear the lead of the play beginning his lines. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice....""I left feeling more happy and excited than I have felt in months.  The next morning I made my way to the theatre which is located at the school which I previously attended. It felt odd going back there but at the same time so completely normal. I was even more comforted by knowing that I could see my friends everyday. I could hug them and laugh with them, I could have social interaction! Something that because of online school I have been lacking. I walked into the theatre and @CAPS3 soon @CAPS3 I did I was bombarded with excited people asking why I was there while hugging me tight. ""I'm helping out with the costuming!"" I said just @CAPS3 excited @CAPS3 they were. I broke away from the group of people and found, @PERSON2 who was on stage directing the lighting people. We talked for a while and then @CAPS7 took me to the costume room where, @PERSON1 was waiting for me. @PERSON1, was a classy looking lady. @CAPS7 wore a light grey cardigan and a colored top with some corduroy pants and sensible shoes. Immediately @CAPS7 started to tell me @CAPS8 my duties were and @CAPS8 I was going to @CAPS12 doing that day.""I'm just going to have you watch the rehearsal today, just to get a feel of @CAPS8's going on."" @CAPS7 handed me a pen and a pad of paper""@CAPS15 notes about where the lighting ques are and that kind of thing."" @CAPS7 said.I walked out and wondered to the auditorium and took my seat in the second row of seats. The lights were lowered and rehearsal began. ""In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice...""@CAPS16 I knew it, the end of the day had come and I wasn't in any hurry to leave. The actors and crew were doing such an amazing job with the play but I knew I had my work cut out for me. In the end it all worked out beautifully, we had some good shows and some @CAPS1 shows but the most important part of this experience was the time I got to spend with the people I love. I am going to miss them so much when I'm sitting in my room all alone doing the school work that consumes my happiness and laughter into the internet. on the other hand, I am all lined up to help with the next two productions going on at that old school of mine."	42
21191	"It was @DATE2 around @NUM1 degrees in west @LOCATION1 me and a couple of friend was really bored and hot all we really had to do was stay home and play video game. So I ended up coming up with the idea of going out side and maybe riding our bikes to the store, an grabbing some ice cream and water then ride up hamburger hill and possibly sit under the shade. Everyone agreed to the plan so all my friends left we all took showers at our homes and met me up at the corner and then rode our bikes off to the store got all the items and as we were making our way to the hill a couple of the big kids who were in middle school came and jumped us all and stole all our of food supplies. Now these guys have always been picking on us for some reason and till this day @CAPS1 still never understood why maybe it was because we didn't like what they did or maybe they hate us cause my friend @PERSON3 stole one of the kids girlfriends but that's a different story. So after they got done pounding our faces into the dirt they got on their bikes and rode off into the sunset like if they were proud of themselves for beating on @NUM2 yr old, our day was ruined i had a black eye,@PERSON3 threw up, @PERSON2 was walking with a limp and poor little @PERSON1 had a little scratch on his tiny little head. After the brutal beating the next day I called a group meeting in our tree house to be for real i was tired of them constantly beating on us stealing our food and giving us ultra wedgies we needed to make a stand against our oppressors cause for too long this has been going on so i devised a plan a perfect plan to make sure they never hurt us again and the plan went like this, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 would talk to all of the kids that have been abused by them and get them to join our revolt,then we would get all of the water balloons eggs and rotten food we could. One of the kids knew that they always left their houses and got on their bikes at @NUM3 pm so at @NUM4 at night me and @PERSON3 would flatten a couple of their tires, each thing that came into my tiny little mind was just genius so after day's of planning and hard labor and complaining to our parents for money the plan was finally set, and so we waited and just like the kid said they all came out at @NUM3 once they noticed their tires had been slashed a couple of the kids jumped out of the bushes and started hurling food at them then me and a couple of the kids was riding past them on our bikes and threw water balloons at them they all split up the ones who's bikes weren't slashed they chased after us they were going pretty fast and nearly caught up with us when i gave the signal @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 pulled the rope and the big kids flew off their bikes and face planted like in the movies and it really seemed like the plan was going pretty well and it seemed like we were winning the war but as usual some thing are to good to be true it seems that we forgot about the other big kids in the neighborhood and when they saw this all hell broke loose soon after their reinforcements came in they over powered us like a lion on a gazelle beating each and everyone of us like we stole something but good thing i was being smart and told my parents and my friends parents on the kids and sooner our parents came yelled and screamed at them and told their parents what's been going on and as a godd ending they were grounded for the rest of them @DATE1 and finally we all played in peace without no fears."	34
21198	"  On the year of @DATE1, my brother had the worst birthday headache ever. We lived in a nice big brown house. with great to loving parents. we had a nice big back yard, my brother and I loved that the most. @CAPS1 was down stars making my brother and i school lunches for school. It was my brothers first day of school and he was so happy. I mean its his birthday and he also starts school on the same day, thats awsome. @CAPS1 let my brother walk to school with me, it was only down the road. The school my brother and i went to is called @LOCATION1. When we got to the school, I could tell my brother was worried. School to me didn't seem that bad but I wasn't the one who was caught eating glue ether. Yeah my brother was caught eating glue during arts and crafts before lunch. When I was on my way to the office I say him through the window. He turned his head and smilled, I could see all the glue still wet and it's everywhere.  My brother and me always had a good relationship, we both mad each other laugh all the time. If my brother and I didn't laugh at each other, we probable wouldn't talk to each other. Laughter to me is a very importent part to any kind of relationship. It alows poth people to share their emotions in a positive way. It also helps people see what kind of sence of humor you have.  As we approched the house, we saw @CAPS1 sitting on the porch waitting for us. After we got home my brother went straight to his room to get cleaned up for his birthday. @CAPS1 had my brother do the dishes, and I do the vacuming in the living room. She always wanted the house cleaned even if people dont come over. @CAPS1 said the whole family was coming over. My brother and i were so happy, we both new grandma was coming. When everyone got here we both were very happy. Grandma showed up alittle after dad did. @CAPS1 was in such a hurry, she wanted to see my brothers face when he saw his birthday cake. When grandma comes she always brings gifts for both of us on are birthdays. When my brother was at the table @CAPS1 brang in the cake. I always see my brother happy, but not like this. I could tell that nothing could make his day any happier.  When the birthday cake was over and the presients, my brother and i went out to the back yard to play kickball. My brother wouldnt use his new soccer ball, we were stuck with a basketball to play with. @CAPS1 and grandma were watching us play, we both were having fun. We laught every time I kicked the ball wrong, or if he missed when he tried to kick the ball. As we were kicking the ball I got an idea. I wound my leg back and as the ball came close i kicked it. I kicked the ball so hard and so fast, insted of the ball going to his feet it went to his head. When the ball conected to his head he did a back flip off the ground. @CAPS1 and grandma were in aw, i was frozen still. When he got up he looked straight at me and laught. @CAPS1 started to laugh so did grandma, i was still frozen. I finaily went with it and by the time I started i couldnt stop. it was so funny, he got pickup off the ground and hit in the head with a ball and still laughs.   When it was time for everyone to go, @CAPS1 said her good byes and then it was grandmas turn. Grandma gave my brother the first kiss on the forhead than me. As grandma was leaving my brother and i sat on moms lap and gave her a big hug and said ""I love you @CAPS1"". @CAPS1 was tcking us in bed and was about to leave when my brother said "" @CAPS1 my head hurts"". I love my family and even today we look back on this and laugh. This has been a joy to write i hope you think so to.  Short story by   @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1"	34
21204	" It was the first day of sophomore year. I had just moved to @LOCATION1 during the @DATE1 so I was nervous about the new school just like any kid would be. I walked into the school and checked out @CAPS4 surroundings. Everything seemed normal enough until I saw it. Near the middle of the sea of tables in the cafeteria was about four tables with around @NUM1 people at each one, but it wasn'@CAPS5 the fact that they were there that caught @CAPS4 attention it was what they were doing. They were dueling with @CAPS1-@CAPS2-@CAPS3 cards right there in the middle of the cafeteria where all could see! I was baffled, I mean I used to duel when I was younger in elementary school when the game was newer, but I had to quit cause everyone in @CAPS4 school stopped dueling, and here I am looking at at least @NUM2 highschoolers just dueling away. What surprised me most of all was that they were right there in the open where everyone could see, and worst of all judge. I moved to a table nearby them and began to watch a kid named @PERSON1 (who later has become one of @CAPS4 best friends.) mop the floor with his opponent. I quickly caught back on to most of the rules, and went home that day thinking ""I'm gonna get back into that game!"". So I bought a deck, and continued @CAPS4 recon of the tables, @CAPS4 deck sitting in front of me waiting for someone to challenge it's master. A few days went by as I continued @CAPS4 silent observation of the duelists. Finally a duelist named @CAPS5.J (another one of @CAPS4 now good friends) challenged me. I accepted and began. He then proceeded to thoroughly kick @CAPS4 butt in the space of what seemed like five rounds into the game. @PERSON1 then taught me he how to play better and we became best friends. He is a really funny guy, and to this day I cant hang around him without laughing. Through him I have met tons of great friends. Even now I wonder what @CAPS4 high school life would be like if they didn'@CAPS5 attend @CAPS4 new school."	31
21209	"Fishing trip gone wrong @CAPS1 me introduce you to what I will be talking about today, fishing. Fishing has been a big part of @CAPS7 life ever since I was born. When I was little I used to go out with @CAPS7 dad and brother to go fishing. @CAPS7 dad loved to take us to go lake fishing. Ive fished every lake around these parts. When I was five years old I got a brand new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole it was so shiny and had a great ball bearing spinning reel. It even had some chrome going up the handle so when the sun hit it just right it would shoot a beams of bright light @CAPS18 the ground. Well as I grew older so did @CAPS7 fishing pole. The reel didn't turn as well and the chrome didn't shine like it used to.  When I turned @MONEY1 @CAPS7 pole was a broken down and just wouldn't work for @CAPS7 fishing needs anymore. So @CAPS18 the day of @CAPS7 tenth birthday @CAPS7 family and friends gave me a some money. I told them that I wanted to buy a new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole. So after @CAPS7 birthday I had acquired one hundred and @MONEY1. I thought I was the richest man in the whole wide world. Latter that night @CAPS7 dad came up to me and told me that @CAPS7 cousins wedding was this @DATE1 and that we might have time after to @CAPS15 a little bit of fishing. I went into the garage and packed @CAPS7 tackle box with pliers, hooks, spinners and all the fishing gear I would need.  After the @CAPS7 cousins wedding @CAPS7 dad said ""@CAPS6 go fishing."" @CAPS7 dad and I changed into our fishing clothes and were off but I had remembered that I needed a fishing pole so I asked ""@CAPS8 dad we need to stop at @ORGANIZATION1 quickly"". It turned out that there was a @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS18 the way. We pulled into the @ORGANIZATION1 parking lot and I went in. I ran over to there sporting goods and found the last @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole siting @CAPS18 the shelf so I got it down and looked it over. This was the pole for me, the only downside was the price that happened to be seventy @MONEY1. I bought it anyways. I walked out of the store with @CAPS7 new @CAPS2 @CAPS3 fishing pole feeling like I was a million bucks.  As we arrived at our fishing spot I noticed that we were not at a lake but a large river. @CAPS7 dad explained that I needed to be safe around the river cause you can get swept away if you fall in. I got out of our car and the wind was harsh. It was chilling to the bone. I took out @CAPS7 new pole and tackle box and started to setup @CAPS7 pole for river fishing. I put @CAPS18 one large weight and big hook. I was ready for anything or at least I thought. I then reached down into @CAPS7 big red tackle box and pulled out a large worm. ""I think the fish will love this."" I say aloud to @CAPS7 dad. Staring out at the fast flowing water and toss @CAPS7 baited fishing line off shore. A big splash of water then ripples, @CAPS7 dad and I smile with satisfaction. Right next to me was a branch buried within the embankment. Setting @CAPS7 pole down rather softly I look upon @CAPS7 dad as he pulls in a fish.  Well @CAPS18 our walk down to river there was this @CAPS13 @CAPS14 outhouse. Me needing to use the restroom, I turned to @CAPS7 right and said to @CAPS7 dad ""@CAPS15 not lose @CAPS7 fishing pole, I don't want it to going flying into the river if I get a big fish @CAPS18."" @CAPS7 dad reply's ""@CAPS17, @CAPS17 just go to the bathroom already."" @CAPS18 @CAPS7 walk to the bathroom I didn't see the big @CAPS19 that had landed near @CAPS7 fishing line. @CAPS7 dad saw them getting closer and closer to @CAPS7 line so he thought it would be a good idea to scare them away. As soon as I walk out of the bathroom @CAPS7 dad goes running and waving his arms at the @CAPS19. They all take off into the air, but something was trailing behind one of them weighing it down. What was it you @MONTH1 ask? It was @CAPS7 brand new fishing pole! It was at least @NUM1 maybe @NUM2 feet in the air. As soon as @CAPS7 pole took off flying it started falling. It didn't land @CAPS18 shore but it landed in the middle of this big wide river. @CAPS7 dad looks at me and says with a smile ""That's the first fishing pole that I've ever seen fly."" I start laughing uncontrollably then @CAPS7 dad starts cracking up. After the laughter was done @CAPS7 dad looked @CAPS18 shore for something to pull @CAPS7 pole in with but to @CAPS7 surprise he found it @CAPS18 shore down river.Will @CAPS20"	42
21215	" Laughter is huge part of everyone's life. It's used to express several different emotions. It's used to bridge the gap between people and break the awkward barrier. People laugh at their own mistakes which show others that they too make mistakes.  Some people can communicate through laughter and know what the other is feeling. For instance one time while i was on a long car ride and very bored and about to fall asleep. So out of no where I began laughing with my friend and laughing different ways and carried on a whole conversation just with laughter. Laughing can bring others together by sharing common interests; everyone laughs. I laugh more than others I'm sure of it. Laughter is a huge part of my life, honestly with out it my life would be boring and depressing. I laugh so much sometimes that my side and stomach hurts so bad. I also make a lot of mistakes and am very clumsy so i get laughed at a lot. My family is a very close and hilarious family we make a lot of mistakes constantly everyday. For my great grandma's @DATE1 we were planning a surprise party. While we were planning it my grandma kept getting suspicious and asking what we were doing. So we kept telling her that we were going to get her a stripper for her @DATE1. So we managed to talk my uncle bobby into being a stripper and climbing out of a box and so he did and it ended up scaring my grandma. Until this day we still talk about that day and laugh about it all the time. Everyday my aunt acts in a ridiculous and funny way and so most of the time i laugh at her. She is always dancing at music on commercials or singing opera. My great grandma always eats foods that make her pass gas, and it's hilarious because sometimes she doesn't even realize that she is doing it. My great grandma also likes to dance and it also hilarious because the dance moves that she knows are far different then the ones today. I believe that with out laughter my family would not be as close as we are. With out laughter i would not be as close to my friends. You can bond over laughter it sometimes forces you to ask questions and get to know people in other ways you would not. It makes you comfortable around people and able to share things and act silly and not worry about your appearance. Laughter can also change your emotion from mad to happy in an instance. For example i was riding dirt bikes with my younger cousin and he decided that he wanted to go through this swamp with his bike. I told him it wasn't very wise because i knew it was not possible for him to go through there with out getting stuck and yet he tried it anyway. So as i assumed he got the bike stuck and since i was the only one with him i had to help him get the bike unstuck. It took forever for us to get the bike out. As soon as we did he tried to drive through again and got it stuck yet another time. I was very upset with my cousin but as i was getting ready to yell and leave him he fell in the mud head first and it instantly changed my mood. Even still today i laugh about the matter even though i didn't think it was very funny at the time.  Even though laughter is good it can also be bad; @CAPS1 laughing at others while they are hurt and crying, or laughing at stupid ignorant pranks, or even laughing at people while they are making bad decisions. Decisions @CAPS1 drinking, drunk people are funny but the fact of being drunk or drinking at all is not. You can actually influence people to make bad decisions by laughing at them. Laughing at them makes them think that it's @CAPS2 to do what they are doing because it is making others laugh. So laughter is healthy but it is also unhealthy in a way."	41
21221	" My Laughter Story @CAPS1 you know that laughing really adds time to your life? Well you do now. Laughter is a great thing to have, because without laughter our world would be dull and pointless. On a day to day basis you should laugh everyday. Laughing can really help you get through a tough time.Me, @PERSON3, @PERSON1, and @PERSON4 were just hanging out up at @ORGANIZATION4's house one day and @PERSON4 was being really funny, all of us were laughing hysterically at what @PERSON4 was saying, then suddenly @PERSON2 calls us and wants to hangout and for us to come to @LOCATION1, but she said only @NUM1 of us can go. So we all debated on who was going to go. We came to a decision and @PERSON4 was the one having to stay back, but @PERSON1 gave him something to keep him occupied. So @PERSON1, @PERSON3, and I were mobbing the bus to @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1. There was a tweaker on the bus and he was making us laugh so hard, but he wasn't even trying. So we arrived at @ORGANIZATION1. We were all hungry so we decided to get some @ORGANIZATION2. When we got to @ORGANIZATION2 we all just got a dollar burger which were rip offs so we all saved our pickles that were on the burger so when we left we could stick them on the windows. We @CAPS1 and it made us laugh so hard we could barley run away. When we arrived at @ORGANIZATION3's apartment we knocked on her door, no one answered, so we knocked again, no answer again. We were just about to call her when she walks out of a different apartment and we all just started laughing because we pounded on someone elses door. When we walked in there was a party going on so we were like nice. When we got there we all had a couple of beers. We were having such a good time we were all just laughing and have the greatest time. That next morning we woke up at @NUM2 a.m because we had to ride the bus back to @LOCATION2 early because it was @DATE1 and the buses run only for a little bit. When we got on the bus the bus driver was making weird faces like he was constipated or something but he made me laugh really hard.When we arrived back in @LOCATION2 we called up @PERSON4 to see what he was doing, he was just hanging out in town so we just went and kicked it with him for the rest of the day and later we all went home. It was a good weekend."	31
21227	" For me there are so many parts in my life that involve laughter. Having fun and laughing are the main things that I do in my life. When I laugh I feel happy, so whenever I'm sad or mad people can always tell a joke or something to make me giggle and then I'm happy again. I love making people laugh. Sometimes when I try and make people laugh I tell a joke but I'm not that funny. When I just be myself, people laugh. I guess I can be funny without even trying.  I have amazing friends, I mean absolutely amazing, although we have our rough days I still love them and thank @CAPS1 for them everyday. My friends and I are always cooking up some way to have fun, and every time we find something to do @CAPS2 always turns out to be funny. Even the little things, such as facial expressions, the way we pronounce a word, or even the way we eat our food makes us laugh. @CAPS2's actually pretty ridiculous. When my friends and I try to tell other people about our extremely hilarious adventures, they all just stare at us as we burst into laughter. @CAPS2's possible that people don't think @CAPS2's funny because they weren't there.   This year my family has an exchange student named, @PERSON1. She is from @LOCATION2. She is very shy and quiet. @PERSON1 never seemed like the type to make me laugh, @CAPS5 boy was I wrong. She is possibly the funniest thing to walk the @LOCATION4. I sure think she's funny, anyway. Sometimes she is so oblivious that @CAPS2 is just hard not to laugh at her. I have a best friend named @PERSON2. We have so many fun memories together. She is amazing and funny. She is so short, people call her a midget, she is quick to reply, ""I am not a midget! I am @NUM1' @NUM2'', you have to be @NUM1' @NUM4'' to be a midget!"" @CAPS2 is so cute when she does this.  I recently moved back from living with my grandparents in @LOCATION1. While I was living there I had been informed (over the phone I might add) that there was a girl living in my old bedroom. ""@CAPS2's a foreign exchange student from @LOCATION2,"" my family told me. I flew back up to @LOCATION3 for @CAPS4 with my family. When I got here I met @PERSON1. She seemed so quiet and sweet. @CAPS2 was late when we got home so I immediately went to sleep. The next day I woke up, called my grandma, then called @PERSON2 and asked her to come over and hang out with me. She came and met @PERSON1. @PERSON1 told us she wanted to get my mom a birthday gift and I replied, ""@CAPS5, that's tomorrow, lets go into town."" All three of us went to town and went to @ORGANIZATION1 For @CAPS6. When we got there we all looked around for something we thought she might like. Somehow, we ended up in the underwear aisle. @PERSON2 picked out a tiny sized pair of underwear and shouted, ""@CAPS7 @PERSON1, what about these?"" @PERSON1 looked at her with the funniest facial expression and shouted back,""@CAPS8, I don't think my thighs would fit through that!"" @PERSON2 and I literally fell onto the floor and laughed so hard that our faces were bright red. Based on our first impression, we thought she was a quiet, ""keep to herself"" kind of girl so we just thought @CAPS2 was hilarious. We tease @PERSON1 about this quite often and she teases back about other funny things we've encountered. I've grown to love @PERSON1 and I love being with her and making fun out of all situations.   "	40
21236	"  Every @DATE1 my family, friends, and I pack up for an exciting trip to @ORGANIZATION1. we always take our @CAPS3 runner, and boat along with us. We rent a large cabin that is right on the water side. We stay for about one week and it is always around one hundred degree's, so we normally spend the majority of the day swimming in the water. It is located over the pass about an hour from @CAPS1. Their are many fun activities to do at @ORGANIZATION1 like @CAPS2, kayaking, aqua cycling, bike riding, boating, and lots more.   This was the first year that my brother had his boating permit and I was very excited because it is way more exciting to have him take us out tubing rather then my parents who go very slow, and they don't make it that much fun. He would always put one of us on the @CAPS3 runner to @CAPS3 the flag when one of us fell off, and one of us would be on the tube. One time he took me and my friend @PERSON1 out. It was in the latter afternoon, and that's when the water gets rough, and choppy. First @PERSON1 was on the tube and I was flagging on the back of the @CAPS3 runner with my brother. He would have us going around in circles at about @NUM1 mph. She ended up flying off right away.   Once @PERSON1 got up on the @CAPS3 runner I hopped on the the tube and i told my brother I was ready. We would do thumbs up to go faster, thumbs down to slow down, and @CAPS3 your arms around like your crazy to stop. He started going and I had my thumb up for a while waiting for him to get going. He started going really fast and I was flying every which way going in circles. Every time I would hit a @CAPS3 I would get whip flash. I put my thumb down to go slower and he didn't slow down he kept going faster, and faster. Then I waved my arms around to make him stop. @PERSON1 was the one watching me, and she thought it would be funny if she told my brother that I wanted to keep going faster. Finally I did about two back flips into the water. I hit the water so fast that it felt like my skin was going to fall off, it hurt so bad.  It took about a minute for me to finally get to the top of the water when I took a huge gasp of air. I was sitting in the water waiting for my brother to drive over and pick me up. Something didn't feel right, I didn't have my bikini bottoms on any more. I started panicking and told my brother not to come over. I looked all around in the water for them but they were no were to be seen. I told my brother and he called my dad. My dad and mom were on there way to bring me a pair of shorts because their was no way I was getting out of the water with no shorts on.   I had a blast at @ORGANIZATION1 and I have a great story that I will be telling for the rest of my life. I cant wait to go back next year and i know that I will be bringing an super tight shorts to go tubing in."	40
21244	"so one time my friends chad, justin and i ding dong ditched this old man. the reason we did this is because we would walk by his house everyday and he would turn on his sprinkler and this annoying alarm thing. so at like nine or ten at night we walked over to his house, banged on his door and ran. it was so funny cuz when we got back from running we went to our friend taylors house and we where sittting in the garage just basking in the glory of what we had just accomplished. about ten seconds later we heard banging on the garage door. at first we where kinda startled so we ran into taylors room, and thats when it happend... the funniest shit ever, the old mad just started scearming and banging on the door then he yelled ""come out boys what are you afraind of?!"" and we just crack up in laughter. well he totally knew we where in there so he went to the front door and started banging on that, waking up taylors mom. wel we ended up going out and talking to the guy and he said he called the cops cause he said it happened all the time. and we denied it was us, but it totally was so we couldnt help but laugh in his ugly face. he seriously looked like a turtle crossed with an eighty year old rapest. he had liver spots on his face and a terrible grey combover that wasnt fooling anyone. by the time the cops showed up the guy was long gone and we told the cop he was senile and didnt know what the hell he was talking about. so we got off scotfree. it was funny and awesome."	30
21249	" It was the first day of the ninth grade, that terrifying day when one must choose how they are to be percieved for the next four years. I walked into my first class looking like a hippie on steroids, just over six feet tall and nearly two hundred and sixty pounds of long haired, freckled teenager. I was a giant, and that made it difficult for bullies to muster up the machismo to treat me as the freshman that I was. I sat down in my designated seat, next to one of the girls I could tell thought too highly of herself. Despite this off putting first impression, I atteampted friendship. My atteampt was met with confusion and disgust.  As I turned to face the front of the class once more, there stood the teacher. @PERSON1 announced that our first assignment was to create a presentation, one that would show the rest of the class who we are. I was excited at the prospect of a presentation. I have always been a showman, and the limelight is a very dear friend. I love to act, sing, and in general entertain. My crown jewel however, is humor. I have found that I can captivate an audience no matter the number, with humor. With this I designed a presentation to entrap and engage my class in the reality of who, and what I am. I wrote a speech in which I explained my talents and the many things I enjoy. In this speech were many twists and turns of phrase, punchlines and puns. There was such laughter that other teachers came to see what was causing the noise.  I took a bow and sat in my seat, looking around at the shining faces of my new friends. I knew then and there that laughter would be the tool with which i would build my highschool life. I could make someone forget about their troubles for a spell, or brighten someones day with a few words. I wasn't a star athlete. I wasn't even a star pupil. But I seemed to collect friends like I was made of fly paper. There is no better feeling i have yet felt, that compares to the company of friends. As long as i have humor, I shall never be without that feeling."	42
21256	" Boy says too @CAPS2:@CAPS1 weigh?, @CAPS2: what? Boy:@CAPS3 i just wanted too say something to break the ice!Laughter is the greatest thing too have in any kind of relationship, such as family, friends, and a romantic type relationship. It bring each other great bondage and makes the relationship playful.It was @DATE1 and i was on my way too pick up a long time no see friend too go to a warped tour concert. We haven't been in the greatest terms because of an issue that was upon us a few months ago. I figure to take my friend @CAPS4 to a concert shes been wanting to go too all year long. When we finally picked her up there was all sorts of tension of unleft said words to each other, but i wasn't gonna wait any longer too see what was about too happen.Before we headed too the concert my parents decided too get a car wash, @CAPS5 then i automatically thought of a few funny things i could do to make her laugh. The car moved as slow as a turtle into the car wash machine. I had left the window crack open to were enough water would crawl in. We were kinda talking about the concert and i had looked very unaware that my window was open, i actually had too no idea that a lot more of water then i expect had came in. She looked across at me and was like laughing so hard see couldn't even speck of what was happening. I looked at her and was like what? She was your windows open and i had turned and came too find water was rushing its way down and sorta frightened me and i jumped into the air and rushed too close the window. She was laughing like there was no tomorrow and so was i. From that moment on it was such an ice breaker for all the tension that was happening. the elephant had left or side and we had a great rest of the day. See, it true""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people"". When laughter is happening no one is truly sad, mad or anything else. Laughter can bring too people who just meet good greetings, too couples closer together, friend and family joy and happiness. Laughter is truly the key to happiness. "	33
21262	" It all started one @DATE1 after school, when my girlfriend and I decided to make a plan to go to my house. We were not planning to walk home, we missed the bus. @CAPS6 we began to walk down the ramp from the high school. While we were walking we got hungry. @CAPS6 we went to the @ORGANIZATION1. We ordered a @CAPS1 and some drinks. @PERSON1 decided to shake up my soda @CAPS13 hand it to me. Me not knowing what's up @CAPS6 I asked, ""@CAPS2 you shake up my soda?"" @CAPS3 said, ""@CAPS4 I @CAPS2 here's mine, let's trade."" I @CAPS2 and ended up opening the one @CAPS3 shook for real. "" That was a lil devious!"" I said. @CAPS6 when I stood up to chase her and poor soda on her, I tripped and fell on some goat heads. While I was in pain, @PERSON1 was cracking up with laughter @CAPS13 said, ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 stupid, who falls over a stump!"" @CAPS6 I got up from the ground and pulled all of the thorns out, @CAPS13 continued to walk home. We were already more than half way to my house, when @PERSON1 decided to hit me in the shin and run. Of course not learning my lesson the first time, I chased her. I chased her for about a block and a half. Basically to my yard before I slid on mud, and @CAPS13 fell in a puddle of water. I thought I was going to loose it when @PERSON1 was laughing too dramaticly. Out of @CAPS14 were, I jumped up and was going to put her face in it. @CAPS3 ended up running inside my house, and locking the door. The reason I knew @CAPS3 @CAPS2 lock it, was because I ran @CAPS6 fast to bust in. before I @CAPS2 I turned the knob, but it didn't open though. Instead the impact forced me to fly back, and land on poop. The bad part was that it was fresh, why, well because my back was warm in a certain spot. I quickly took off my shirt and threw it away, @CAPS13 headed inside to shower. @PERSON1 asked me why I was going to shower, but I decided to lie to her. @CAPS12 I told her what really happen, @CAPS13 @CAPS3 will laugh and make fun of me. After I was done showering I asked @PERSON1, ""@CAPS7 you want to go shoot some glass bottles in the back?"" @CAPS3 replied, ""@CAPS9 I'm down let's go!"" @CAPS6 I set up six bottles and was ready to shoot. First @PERSON1 tried and hit four out of six. That's pretty good for being a girl. @CAPS6 I went to replace the four bottle @CAPS3 shot. As I was doing @CAPS6 @CAPS3 shot me in the butt.""@CAPS11!"" I yelled and wanted to cry, but I didn't. The only thing I @CAPS2 was swore like @CAPS14 other, and aimed my gun to @PERSON1 to get her back. @CAPS3 was quick to run upstairs and grab my @NUM1. @CAPS3 said with a freaked out voice, ""@CAPS12 you come any closer I'll throw this out the window!"" @CAPS13 I said to her, ""@CAPS14 you won't, you know how much I paid for that!"" @CAPS15 my luck shot her in the leg. Well turns out @CAPS3 wasn't lieing bout throwing it out the window. It was ok though, because I could get another one. That @DATE1 with @PERSON1 was great, but @CAPS3 laughed at me most of the time. I didn't care, whatever makes her happy. I really @CAPS7 like making her smile. I delt with a lot of pain that day, and lost a shirt with poop. It's all good though, it's going to be a great memory when we look back on this day. "	36
21268	" Laughter is a part of my life. When I laugh, I always have this feeling of happiness and a connection with others. Laughter makes any relationship stronger. I remember when I was sad, I would go and talk to my friend @PERSON2. I went to him because we could talk about why I was feeling that way. Then after a while we would be laughing - being happy. Laughter brought me closer to my friend. We were able to understand each other. We have been friends since we were in elementary. Because of laughter in our relationship and memories of days when we laughed, it has made this relationship last. I have been mad at my friend and he has been mad at me. But because of all those good times we have had laughing . We are still great friends.Here is a time when laughter was in one of my friend relationships. @PERSON2, @PERSON1 and I were at @ORGANIZATION1's house. It was a @DATE1. We were listening to music and talking about stuff. We didn't do much that day. Except the thing that they were about to do. Out of nowhere @PERSON2's little nephew starts dancing and laughing while doing it. @PERSON1 gets up and does the same. @PERSON2 then gets up too- it was something I didn't expect to happen. They chose a certain song and made a dance for it. The whole time this was happening we were all having a good time. They all looked funny doing their dance. After a while @PERSON2 and @PERSON1 got tired. But we kept on laughing because @PERSON2's nephew kept on dancing. They danced to this song a few other times that @DATE1. It was still funny to me the last time as it was the first time they did it. Laughter connected my friendship many other times. This one though, is the one I mostly remember because it was funny. I remember it like if it was just last week. Being happy in a relationship makes it last a long time. That is why I think laughter is important and it does really make any relationship stronger. I have this story to prove it."	38
21274	" Laughter is important in many ways. It can help you solve an argument with a friend, improve your health, and help in akward situations. All relationships need a little laughter to lighten the mood once in awhile. If we didn't have it, everything would be taken seriously all the time, and there would be many more feuds. One instence where laughter has helped, was when my best friend, @PERSON1, and I were in a big fight about someone spilling paint on a pair of shorts she owned. We were both accusing one another, and the more that happened, the worse the fight became overall. I remember right in the middle of the fight, @PERSON1 made a face that for some reason made me laugh. Once I laughed I could tell she wasn't amused. She began questioning why I was laughing. So I explained to her why I had been laughing, and she ran to the bathroom and looking into the mirror, made the same face that I had been laughing over. To my surprise, she started laughing as well. After the ten-minute laughing fit, I made a joke about the paint on her shorts, and we decided to splatter them with paint for a rather ""unique"" look. Needless to say, laughing saved us from getting into an even bigger argument. When people are angry or upset, physically they probably don't feel that good. They @MONTH1 feel angry for days, which in turn can give them physical pain. I know for me if I'm angry long enough I'll succumb to a headache and ironically, I get more angry at people around me because my head hurts and they're making it worse. Laughing is a way of @CAPS1 things go. Not necessarily being carefree, but learning to let go and live. Physical health is greatly affected by laughter. As well as mental health. Everyone needs to laugh to stay sane. Learning to not sweat the small stuff is really important. My favorite thing to hear is ""let go laughing."" @CAPS1 go of a problem while laughing is the best way to get rid of problems. I've also noticed that when you laugh more you feel better overall. You have more energy, but that's usually from the endorphines kicking in when you have a crazy fit of laughter. But also it lightens the mood tons when you're with other people. All people need to laugh. Married couples, students, teachers, and best friends. Laughing can bring people together. In the end, laughing can benefit you in many ways. It can help resolve feuds, lighten moods, and have good effects on your mental and physical health. And the best thing to always remember is to let go laughing."	40
21280	"                                    Laughter @CAPS1 @CAPS2 For the @ORGANIZATION1 is a very important thing in life , I personally could not live without laughter in my life I honestly could not do it. I would not be me if I didn't have laughter in my life . All relationships should have laughter involved in some way ,what would a relationship be without laughter! Laughter is a beautiful thing , when I am laughing I am enjoying life in in my own way and my worries instantly go away and some how I feel like I am ""carefree "" . Laughter makes us healthy both physically and mentally . Through out my life there have been many times where laughter has been involved in many relationships . But let me tell you about a time where laughter really stood out and was and still is a big part of my relationship with my dad.   I have always been very close to my dad , you might even say I am a daddy's little girl .Laughter has played a very important role in my relationship with my dad. It somehow always found its way into our relationship. The @CAPS1 times of laughter are what I valued and treasured so much that whenever I think about it I cant help but smile . I remember when I was little if I ever needed a @CAPS1 laugh my dad was the person to call . The laughter grew stronger through out the years , I cannot recall a time where my dad and I had a moment where laughter was not involved . We always used to watch these @CAPS3 shows together that we would almost always laugh so hard it was impossible to get through the show without making noise or miss something because we were both laughing so hard .We would laugh so hard we would wake up the whole family ,sometimes we didn't even know why we were laughing it would just happen . I can just hear those sweet sounds of laughter between my dad and I oh how I miss those @CAPS1 @NUM1 nights were what I looked forward to, I knew that I would soon be laughing along with my dad and tears of joy would be running down our faces . I looked forward to that sweet sound of laughter it was almost impossible to go through the entire show without laughing ,oh what @CAPS1 times those were . Since my dad moved to @LOCATION1 ,we haven't had those beautiful times of laughter that I miss so much, but I can always treasure them in my heart. Those moments of laughter were the best moments I have ever had with my dad,since I was little girl till now almost an adult . I don't know if my dad and I would be as close today if we hadn't had all that laughter throughout our lives. Whenever I am sad or miss my dad , I go back to those times we had filled with laughter, and listen to his laugh playing in my head. I never knew how important laughter would be to me. I am glad laughter played such an important part in my life. Laughter is such an important part of life/relationships because it brings joy and happiness. Laughter is the type of thing that no matter what , should always be a part of any relationship. I think laughter is healthy for our bodies, for example if you're sad ,depressed ,or just not having a @CAPS1 day a @CAPS1 laugh will change that and make you feel a lot better ,like it did for my dad and I. Laughter also makes relationships last longer , the reason why I am so close to my dad , best friend, mom, boy friend , sisters etc is because of laughter itself . If laughter was not involved in my relationships , I could not handle being sad all the time everyone needs a little laughter sometime in their life. My dad is the reason why I laugh so much , he showed me how laughter is such a powerful thing but yet so simple. I never thought laughter would be such an important part of my life until my dad showed me just how valuable it really is.  Where I would be today without laughter I truly have no idea. My dad taught me how laughter can change your attitude on things and how important it is to have laughter in your relationship. If laughter was not involved in any relationship , the world would be very boring no laughter or smiles,can you imagine having no laughter at all! I certainly cant imagine life without laughter. If my relationship with my dad had no laughter we would not be the same people we are today in fact , we would be completely different people and we would not be as close as we are today. What do you think about laughter? Has laughter ever played an important part in any of your relationships?  "	40
21287	"Laughter is the shortest distance between two peopleFor the longest time I never thought that I could be happy. I felt as if every time I tried, someone was always there to say ""@CAPS1 no, she's about to be happy. Better take everything away from her."" That's @CAPS2 always happened; I was the one being dumped, cheated on, or losing a best friend. I would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe someday someone out there would listen and care and understand. I didn't think that wish would come true, but somehow it did. @PERSON2 was the type of guy you could tell anything to. He would listen and care as if it was his problem also. That's @CAPS2 attracted me most to him. His sense of knowing when things weren't right and attempting to make them better. The thing I loved most about him was how he could make me happy when I felt so down. He didn't live close to me, he never came over and we barely knew each other but he made me smile better then anyone I've know for years. I guess I never believed laughter is the shortest distance between two people. It didn't take long for that to be proven wrong.Freshman year and I was lost. I just wanted to be popular, make friends and get a good boyfriend. My main focus that drove me through each class period was boys. It wasn't the best thing I could have focused on but hey, they got me through. I still remember sitting in my math class when a tall boy with brown-blond hair sat in the front row. @PERSON2 was his name, and I suddenly became attached. I did @CAPS2 most girls do when they see a cute guy. Made a fool of myself. I was so sure that I was never going to get a chance with him until I got his number. The story goes on from there, we dated and dumped. For a while we didn't talk. But that's @CAPS2 made us bond even more. We later became best friends, and that is how I became happy.My boyfriend, was not a good boyfriend at all. It took me a while to realize this because I was entranced on his ability to make me feel important. I assumed I wasn't important when I called @PERSON2, crying the night he cheated on me. Usually when you ask a boy to help you with your problems, they don't know @CAPS2 to say. But when I talked to @PERSON2 he seemed as if he was going through the same thing. His perspective on the dilemma helped me get through it. I talked to him for the longest time that night, explaining how I felt. To my surprise, he actually cared and listened. After hours upon hours of talking, @PERSON2 and I finally realized that we have to be related in someway. Him and I have so much in common. We have both been through the same scenarios and we both help each other get past it. One time after a dance @PERSON2 called me saying, ""I cried, when @PERSON1 left tonight."" I helped him. Then later that month, he thought she was cheating on him. I helped him. I remember calling him one night and he woke up just to hear me tell him I quit the dance team. People tell me not to get too attached to him, but I cant help it. We don't even have to be in the same room and he makes me smile. All the things we have been through make me laugh. He makes me laugh. He isn't the class clown or the comedian, but its just something in the way he can be himself and not get embarrassed that's @CAPS2 makes him so fun to be around. We @MONTH1 fight and not get along sometimes but I know he will always be there when I need him.Sometimes I sit and think back to the beginning of the year. When I was timid, quiet and unhappy. I think of how @PERSON2 is the most caring guy but you wouldn't notice it unless you got to know him. I think, ""@CAPS2 if I never met @PERSON2"" and I wonder if I would be the same person I am today. I now recognize that I have changed so much over these few months. Maybe its from @PERSON2, or maybe its just myself. But I'm pretty sure laughter has something to do with it. It brought me and @PERSON2 together in the beginning and it keeps us together even now. From being total strangers and now best friends. Maybe it is true; laughter is the shortest distance between two people."	40
21292	" Laughter can change any situation. It can be used to break the awkward silence after a bad joke is told, to reminisce about a fond memory, or to clear ones head and create the feeling of calmness. In @DATE1 opinion laughter is a form of communication. I discovered this through the coarse of the @DATE1 through many different situations. Many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who I was able to connect with through laughter.  One of @DATE1 experiences with laughter has been with the many different exchange students that @DATE1 family has hosted. We have gotten exchange students from @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, and @LOCATION4. Most of them have rather good broken @CAPS1, but there were some words that proved difficult to describe and translate.  @DATE1 favorite exchange students was @PERSON1, a student from @LOCATION3. She lives in the northern part of the @LOCATION3, in the @LOCATION2 country. In the @LOCATION2 country they speak @CAPS2 and @LOCATION2 and culture is slightly different form the rest of @LOCATION3. What made @PERSON1 so enjoyable was her cheerful personality, her empathy, and her ability to make anyone in the room genuinely burst in to fits of laughter. I believe that this incredible ability of her's was one of the reasons that the summers I spend with her are some of @DATE1 happiest memories.  @PERSON1 could turn any activity into a lighthearted experience. I would do tasks with her like washing the dishes, a chore I didn't usually enjoy, and the entire time we would guffaw at the most outrageous things. Together we would laugh until tears were streaming from our eyes and we felt the need to go to the bathroom.  Once @PERSON1, @DATE1 best friend @PERSON2, and I spent an entire day laying in the grass at a park putting on ridiculous skits for each other, and telling comical stories, laughing until our bellies hurt. Between out bursts of laughter @PERSON1 would exclaim ""@CAPS3 you have got to stop this or I will surely explode, I have to use the restroom every ten minutes!"" @CAPS4 she would say this we would look at each other and be back to rolling on the ground laughing.  When I went to visit @PERSON1 in @LOCATION3 we had many similar situations of outrageous, uncontrollable laughter. One day we went to the @LOCATION2 parliament building with our families, @PERSON1, her sister @CAPS5, @DATE1 sister @PERSON3, and I couldn't stop acting goofy and cracking up. We toured through the serious quiet building unable to be silent or stoic, laughing at each other uncontrollably, making funny faces and dancing around, unable to contain our joy.  I don't know @PERSON1 @CAPS4 well @CAPS4 @DATE1 friends back home, but I think I will always feel a deeper connection to her then most people because with her I feel the free ability to laugh at every and anything. I have heard many different facts about laughter; if you laugh before an exam you will do better on it, moments of laughter are more prominent in your memories, and a person that laughs daily is more likely to feel less stressed and have a happier @DATE1, but the reason that I love to laugh is that it makes me feel really fantastic."	50
21297	"  It all started at the play ground @CAPS9 me my friend @PERSON3 and @PERSON2 were just sitting around and we saw these two girls walk up and it was these girls from school @PERSON1 and @CAPS1. We didn't know who it was at first so we sat back all cool like tell i noticed it was them @CAPS9 they got closer. They ran up and said ""hey guys want to go on a adventure to the woods"" ""sure why not"" we all said ""we ain't got nothing better to do so we walked which seemed like @NUM1 miles @CAPS9 it was only @NUM2 feet from the play ground it felt like a long way either way i was lazy at the time.  @CAPS9 we got into the @CAPS2 it had a lot of bushes and trees that we thought we could make a fort out of bushes and chill and eat donuts from @ORGANIZATION1 there but what we didn't know was there was something living in that @CAPS2 that we were not aware of. Turns out we went into the wrong @CAPS2 and there was a lot of animals in the place we went into. So as i was sitting on the long by the creek i saw a brownish figure walk by deep into to the woods them closet person to me was @PERSON1 and i jumped up and grabbed her and from there i knew were going on adventure to go find whatever was living out there. @CAPS9 we started walking all i could see was trees and bushes tell i heard @PERSON1 say ""there is something over there by the big tree with vines so we approached the tree with caution not knowing what was going to happen. We stood behind a little fallen over log that was there for awhile.As we watched the big tree and the huge hollow hole that was in the side of it we heard a loud growling nose from inside the tree i got up from behind the tree and went over to check it out but before i could take a step @PERSON1 grabbed my jacket and told it look to dangerous ""alright"" i said with disappointment cause i really want to go see what was in that tree. We started walking back to get the others turns out they have been looking for us for over @NUM3 minutes ""sorry"" we both said"" but you guys have to check this out @CAPS7 so narly"" i said with animosity. ""@CAPS5 what is it"" @PERSON3 said ""don't know but it sounds big and scary and mean"" said @PERSON1 "" ""oh daaanngg"" @PERSON2 said ""i think were gonna die if we got back over there"" @CAPS1 complained. ""@CAPS7 gonna be just fine"" i said so we all looked at each other alright everyone said in a scared voice. ""@CAPS8 is gonna be alright trust me i know a spot were we can watch the tree without getting close to the animal or whatever is in there""I said   @CAPS9 we were walking down there to go see the animal @CAPS1 didn't want to go see the animal anymore so we argued for a little bit then we all came to a agreement that @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 stay up the hill a little ways and we will run back if anything is wrong. We got behind the tree and watched the tree me @PERSON3 and @PERSON1 didnt know what to see or wait for @CAPS9 something would come out of that tree.  I could not wait any longer it was begining to take forever then i got up and said ""lets go see what is in that tree"" ""im with you so lets @NUM4 said. We walking around the tree keeping our distance @CAPS9 we heard that growling noise again we backed off a little bit but kept going we got a little bit closer @CAPS9 i saw something some out of the tree. It was a huge mountain loin we ran as fast as we could up the hill. I was looking back trying to follow the sound of screaming from @LOCATION1 but @CAPS9 i looked up it was really @PERSON3 i could not help laughing @CAPS9 we got @PERSON2 and @CAPS1 i kept laughing all the way to @ORGANIZATION1. As soon as we got into @ORGANIZATION1 we were all out of breath especially me cause i could not stop laughing about @PERSON3 and how i thought he was @PERSON1 cause he was screaming like a girl. ""@CAPS13 up"" he said ""that wasn't me it was @PERSON1"" even though @PERSON1 was running beside me the hole time. We walked into a little more into @ORGANIZATION1 and there was a big box of donuts sitting right by the deli and we ran over there and got two box's which had a total of @NUM5 donuts in them then we got a big gallon of soda and chilled in @ORGANIZATION1 and ate the hole thing in @NUM6 minutes. I will always remember that day as one of the craziest days of my life. "	32
21302	" We all understand the benefits of laughter. I believe that laughter is an important part of life that everybody should experience. The time that I remember most where I have laughed and enjoyed myself was when my family and I went to @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION3.It all started with @DATE1. We were opening our presents when my @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 told me and my siblings that they had one last present for us but it was a surprise; in order to know what it was we had to find it. So they told us as a hint, that it was someplace that we sleep. As soon as they told us that I knew exactly where to look, our bedrooms. So we raced up the stairs to our bedrooms and looked around. To our delight, sitting on our nightstands where four packets full of info about @ORGANIZATION1. We were so excited and happy. My little sister said that it was the best @DATE1 present ever. We ran down the stairs, hugged @CAPS1 and @CAPS2, and told them that they are the best @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 ever. What made it even better was that we would miss school. Then we found out that the trip was scheduled for the month of @DATE2. So we had to wait for four months. Those four months were the longest of my life. Four months later it was finally time to go. We had to wake up around @NUM1 a.m because our plane was scheduled to depart at @TIME1. Before we left our house I asked my @CAPS1 if I could bring my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 with me so that I was not bored on the plane. She told me that I could, only if I share it with my little brother. Once we had finally left home I started feeling like I had butterflies in my stomach. I guess it was because something fun and exciting was about to happen to me. When we got to the airport it was @NUM2 so we had about an hour and fifty-five minutes till the plane left. Luckily I had my @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Since my brother was only six years old he easily gets bored, I let him play my @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 till we had to board. When it was finally time to board one of my sisters had to use the restroom. My @CAPS1 ended up taking her while my @CAPS2 stayed with us and boarded the plane .My other sister did not like that my @CAPS1 was not on the plane with us yet. So my @CAPS2 told me to keep my brother and sister in their seats while he went o find my @CAPS1 and sister. Five minutes later they all came back, and just in time too. The plane had just finished refueling and we were on the way to the runway. One of my favorite parts of being on a plane is when it's speeding down the runway at amazing speed. And when we finally reached the speed we needed to be at, we launched in to the air and my stomach felt like it was in the open air. My little brother is holding on to my hand so tight that his little knuckles turn white. It gave me the impression that he was scared so I told him to just think about it as a really fast car that goes over a bump. That seemed to help a lot because he started laughing when the plane left the ground. He said that it was fun and wanted to do it again. I reminded him that once we got to @ORGANIZATION1 we would go on all the rides that we want. Three hours later we arrived in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3. Once we got off the plane we went to pick up our bags from the baggage claim. My @CAPS2 went to see when the next @CAPS11 @CAPS12 was scheduled to arrive. As he came back the @CAPS12 was just coming down the road. The @CAPS12 was blue with @CAPS11 characters. The driver showed us a lot of cool things and places. The @CAPS15 that we were staying in was called The @CAPS14 @CAPS15. It had a huge pool shaped like a guitar. Once we were settled in we went in to @LOCATION1. It was really fun because my sisters and I got all the @CAPS11 characters autographs and pictures. My favorite one was @CAPS17 because he reminds me of myself. We got to stay in the park for about three hours when we started getting hungry so we left and went back to the @CAPS15. After dinner we went down to the pool to go swimming. It seemed to be funner than @ORGANIZATION1 because in the week we were there we spent more time laughing and swimming down by the pool than actually in @LOCATION1. That is the best time that I had ever had in my life and I owe it all to my parents. I love them very much. Thank you."	40
21309	" Some people say that laughter is the best medicine. I strongly agree with these people, because I believe that any funny situation in which there is laughter can put anyone into a better mood. Just taking the time to laugh at something or yourself is something that every person should do. Having agood time with friends and family and laughing with them is truly something to be greatful for. I have had several situations filled with laughter. @CAPS2 I am greatful for. My two best friends, @PERSON2@NUM1, and I, well lets just say there is hardly a time when we are together that there is not laughter involved. So many times we've laughed at ourselves and each other I've lost count. It's so amazing to have these two great friends to laugh along with. There are so many times that we have laughed at eachother I don't even know where to begin. One time we were all at @ORGANIZATION1's house and we were playing hide and seek in her back yard. It was my turn to be the seeker. I came out of the house after counting to @NUM2. As I searched the yard I found everyoneeventually, except @PERSON2. As I wondered the yard looking for her the others started helping me look for her.We could hear her laughter coming from somewhere, but we couldn't tell where. She started talking to us saying things like ""@CAPS1 here!"" or ""@CAPS2 way!"". After getting frustrated and giving up, she finally revealed herself...on the roof of her house! We all laughed so hard, not even knowing how she got up there in the firstplace.  Another time we had gone to pizza for my @NUM3 birthday party. We went into the arcade room with the moneywe had ready to play some games. We told ourselves to avoid the claw machine, because we knew we would not want to stop and waste all of our money. But of course @ORGANIZATION2 had to try it just once. Next thing we, knewwe were using all of our money trying to win at @CAPS2 game. We each eventually won something, screaming, cheering, and laughing hysterically like kindergartners. We had also played @CAPS2 race car game at least ten timesand we were running out of games to play. So to relieve our boredom we started playing the race car game driving with our feet instead of our hands. It was a very fun time.  I couldn't possibly tell all of these stories. That would take hours, days, maybe even weeks. But I can tell youthat laughter is definitely a huge part of our day to day lives. I consider myself a very lucky person to have suchgreat friends that laughter is such a common thing for us. Not a lot of people are fortunate enough to have thisopportunity. A little laughter can go a long way. So the next time you see someone who looks like they need a friend or like they could just use a good laugh, talk to them, attempt to be their friend, make them laugh. The resultwill be its own reward. Trust me."	38
21319	" The snow shimmered in the sunlight like sequins. @CAPS1 and I rushed to her bedroom window to get a better look. A blanket of white covered the ground. Quickly we strapped ourselves into air-restricting snowsuits. She opened the wooden front door and the chilly air stung my nose. @CAPS6 we hurried out into any @NUM1 graders paradise. @CAPS1 and I had both been through some rough times in the past few months. I shielded myself from the fact that recently my muscular brown horse was put to death by a giant bolt of light and a loud thunder clap. @CAPS1 had just learned her parents were getting a divorce. Being best friends, we had been through a trail of tears that year, but all was forgotten when our legs hit the cold wet snow. We raced to her garage in panic to find sleds. As we ran through the house to the back door we were stopped by @CAPS1's short tan mom. She refused to let us go outside until we ate breakfast. We chomped down a bowl of the always tasty @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and gulped down a tall glass of juice. @CAPS6 we flew out the back door with our sleds. There the giant hill waited for us. It slopped downward in a perfect @NUM2 degree angle with only a few turns. The wood piles and thorny blackberry bushes that lined our sledding course taunted us. As my eyes wandered down the path of snow I heard @CAPS1 yell, ""@CAPS5!"" @CAPS6 I saw her whipping her way down the slope. I grabbed my red racer sled and took off after her. I approached my first turn. It hooked around left like the start of a figure eight. With ease I glided around the corner and saw a snapshot of the woodpile that sat on my right. I looked up to see the old pond at the bottom of the hill. The sun shone through slivers of the trees surrounding it like moonlight dancing on ice.  Confidently I approached my second turn. I spun around the corner sharply. I stared up ahead to see @CAPS1's bright blue sled reaching the finish line. That was when my eyes caught a glimpse of her neighbors bay horse and all my happiness floated away. As I got lost in my thoughts about @LOCATION1, I also lost focus. My shoulders hit the snow as if it were concrete. My legs tangled into knots and I could feel my head pounding. The sled had abandoned me. I tumbled down the hill like an avalanche. Eventually, the kind hands of a blackberry bush reached out to stop me. The thorns stabbed my neck. Carefully, I plucked each thorn from my neck and retreated to the bottom of the hill by foot.  By the time I reached my final destination, @CAPS1 couldn't breath. With her head buried in the snow, her abs were bouncing up and down with the rhythm of her laugh. She looked up at me, her bright green eyes and flushed pink cheeks told me how silly I had looked tumbling down the hill. She started to laugh one last time when a giant snot bubble burst out of her nostril. She started to crack up and I fell to the ground in a burst of laughter. I couldn't look at her anymore. Every time I glanced in her direction it became even more funny. I nudged my head into the snow just as she had done earlier. Finally when we had ourselves under control we looked up at each other. Our mascara was smeared around our eyes and down our cheeks. We resembled either clowns with a horrible makeup job or strange looking raccoons. Our laughs started to grow again, but quickly died down. Together we stood up. We spotted my bright red sled down by the frozen pond. ""@CAPS9 like a nice hike,"" I said. @CAPS6 we both started on our journey through the forest to retrieve it.  When I came shooting down the hill like a meteor, and she shot that snot bubble out of her nose like a rocket ship, I forgot everything. It was the first time in months that both of us felt at ease with our hardships. Laughter is the biggest connection we have with each other. When I laughed, my mind shut out the whole world. On snow days we now laugh to remember that cold @DATE2 day, but on that @DATE1 day we were laughing to forget.  "	46
21325	" The night was a cool, @DATE1 night, not too cold but definetly not the muggy temperatures @DATE2 brought you. This was the type of @NUM1 degree weather that would allow you to wear jeans and a t-shirt and still be comfortable. The air hugged my skin as I walked up the path that led to my friends front door. Overhead I knew the stars hung in the sky but they were paid no attention by me. Inside the house I knew both of my bestfriends were awaiting my arrival. I also knew that there was a potential of them being angry with me. For what, I did not know. I did know that when I left school that day there was a feeling in my gut that told me something wasn't right. Walking home, as I increased the distance between them and me, there was a churning in my stomach that prodded me to look back. When I did, they were both staring at me with looks I couldn't (or didn't want to) place on their faces.  All of that made my heart give occasional, hard, thumps on my chest from the nervousness. Yet, I pretended that everything was okay. ""For all I know"", I told myself, ""it might as well be, and I'm overreacting."" I knocked on the white-painted wooden door and stared at the maroon side-paneling, waiting for an answer. My friend @LOCATION1 answered the door. From somewhere inside I could hear my other friend @PERSON1 laughing. I knew that I had missed out on something, the laughter explained that to me as I stepped inside. There was a hollow feeling in my chest. I wanted to know what I had missed out on. I hated not knowing. A mix of emotions jumped around inside my body, causing my head to be a jumbled mess that I couldn't make sense of.  I gently pushed open @LOCATION1's bedroom door with my fingertips. Like always, the turquoise walls and the sound of radio station music jumped out to greet me. @PERSON1 was laughing and dancing to the music, but when she saw me, she stopped and stared. The moment seemed to stretch and expand in time. I felt my guard go up. If she was mad, fine. I didn't do anything wrong and I would maintain my innocence. The moment was stretching and stretching to the point I thought it might break, then @CAPS1 hugged me, completely catching me off gaurd, but filling me with a sense of right, because I'd known I hadn't done anything wrong. Everything seemed normal for what felt like a second and then @PERSON1 explained the gut feeling I had when I was walking home from school that day. I was being accused of not putting in any work into a reading project. The accusation appalled me and deflated my pride. Instead, a mild anger boiled up and I simply walked out the door and into the cool night. I heard my friends calling my name and following me down the street but I kept walking. I told myself this was out of anger, but @DATE3 I know it was for the sake of making a scene.  The footsteps I listened for behind me suddenly came at a faster pace. I glanced over my shoulder and saw @PERSON1 running at me. Against my will, I let out a high-pitched scream and started running, digging my feet into the concrete sidewalk. I felt determination flow through my veins. I would walk all the way home in the dark to make my point. @PERSON1 caught up to me and tried to pull me back to the house but I resisted with all my might. I knew I couldn't get out of her grip, out of sheer stubborness, I planted my butt on the curb and refused to budge. I realized I had only passed two houses. My friends exchanged glances and picked me up by my arms and legs and started carrying me towards the direction of the house. I grasped for the anger that was slipping from my hands. I wanted to stay mad but I couldn't. I started laughing and any tension I still felt swarming around me lifted up and flew away. A grin decorated my face from one ear to the other and my good sense came back to me gracefully. They set me down in the middle of the road. I looked up and admired the stars, that I had missed before, winking at me from above. The last ribbons of laughter still danced around in the air and whispered to me that everything was going to be okay."	45
21332	"Laughing @CAPS1 you remember when you would laugh so hard you couldn't breathe? Or when you started crying because you were laughing? When ever I start laughing I am always with my best friend, @PERSON1. We sometimes even when things aren't funny. We giggle at everything. Memories, the future, or even just looking at each other we laugh. You name it, we've laughed at it.  @PERSON1 and I have almost always laughed together. From when we first met in seventh grade, and now when I am a freshman, we still don't ever stop. She was in my sixth period class and we sat by each other. After the first couple of minutes we talked we both knew something good was going to come from this. So of course, from that moment on we had to be best friends. I couldn't ask for a friend better then her. She is the best.  All of our free time was spent with one another. Even some time when we were busy we were still together. @PERSON1 and I were together basically every day and every night. We would camp out in my backyard, or ride bikes around the town. I would go swimming with her family. She would go to @LOCATION1 with ours. Both of both of our families would go and @CAPS1 things together. We did all sorts of things together. No matter what we always laughed.  Growing up can be pretty tough sometimes for anybody. @PERSON1 and I were no exception to this. After a bad day, you would know you could find us on the phone talking to each other. We could talk for hours and hours about the littlest things. I think we have talked for three hours before just about what we were going to wear the next day. Never hanging up until one of us getting told to get off the phone. I think I can speak for the both of us when I say, we hung up with a completely different outlook on life. Even on the worst of our days, we were still laughing. I don't think I would ever be able to grow up with out her. @PERSON1 is such a big part of my life. I would be nothing without her.  @PERSON1 and I @CAPS1 not go to the same school anymore, but that still doesn't prevent us from laughing. If you have ever had a friend as close to you as @PERSON1 is to me, you know how great it feels to be close to somebody. Just think about the feeling of never ending laughter. I strongly believe with all of my being, it is one of the best feelings in the world. @PERSON1 and I never stop, why should I let anybody else. With out laughter, we wouldn't be as close as we are today. With out laughter the world wouldn't be how it is today. So find a friend and start laughing. You'll see how great it is to laugh with someone. I guarantee it."	40
21339	"@PERSON1                               @CAPS1 @CAPS2 One @DATE1 of @DATE1 break me and a @CAPS3 went @CAPS1 with my @CAPS5 on the boat in @LOCATION1. We have been waiting all week for to go catch some @DATE1 @CAPS4 salmon. That @DATE3 @TIME1 we had to get the boat ready so we can leave that day. Our boat is big so we just put all our stuff in it, like sleeping bags, coolers of food, and all the @CAPS1 gear we would need for salmon. we also brought a camp stove for our food we make on the boat. There was also another guy named @PERSON2 but we call him big @PERSON2 hes very funny guy that provided a lot of laughter on the boat.When we get there we had to stop at a bait shop to get some prawns and spinner blades, that's what we use to catch the salmon.  We leave and soon as we get to the boat ramp were we launch the boat my @CAPS5 realizes that he forget to get hooks while we were at the shop. So we pull the boat out of the water, luckily the boat was still on the trailer, we get all the stuff all secure in the boat again and leave to the shop. Right as we get to the bait place the lady we talk to earlier said we forgot to grab the hooks we bought, some how we did forget I don't know how though. So we say thanks and headed back to the river. We finally get our boat in the water and head up river to were we are going to do our @CAPS1, and it is a popular place there would be a line of boats called a hog line and some how we would always some how get in the middle where the best @CAPS1 is. There would be some days usually @DATE2 like @NUM1 boats on each side of us and it got hectic and some times funny because some of the guys out there don't even know how to operate a boat.  When we got there after we geared our poles up we put them out in the water, my pole went down and hooked a nice bright @CAPS4 and fought him for about fifth teen minutes and my @CAPS5 netted it and it was a keeper fish. After all that my @CAPS5 said that was a small fish. Right around dark we reeled are poles in and put them away neatly in the boat. Right when it got dark it was time for bed and it was quite on the river there was no one on the river besides so we didn't have to worry about other people rocking our boat while we were sleeping. The next morning was cold and windy but luckily we brought our top to cover us from getting wind burn, because last time we went we got wind burnt so bad it hurt for about a week. finally my buddies pole goes down and hes all excited about hooking a fish, about ten minutes go by and he realizes he hooked on a log that floated by, me and my @CAPS5 knew he hooked on it but we didn't want to say any thing because it would be funny him getting all excited. My @CAPS5's pole goes down and it was fish on, so i throw the anchor out we float down get it in the net another fish too take home and we had two in the boat but my buddy is the only one that needs to get a fish so we all have one to take home.  After all day of being on the boat it was about time to head off home and get ready for the begging of the week. Right about two o clock, I look over my pole tip slams to the water another fish on hand it to my buddy he's fighting it, he was having trouble reeling though because the drag was tight but then i fix it he gets in the boat, his first salmon ever he was happy. perfect timing, because about fifteenth minutes later we leave to go home. the @CAPS2 was fun we got some fish, we had some funny moments, and most of all I got my buddy his first salmon.      "	34
21345	"Laughters importance in human life   In life there are many things that make a person happy but none come close to the joy of laughter. @CAPS1 and friends always come together and share a good laugh, it's why we get together, to have a great time with the ones we love and enjoy being around. My @CAPS1 every year gets together on thanksgiving and it is always one of my favorite times becuase when my @CAPS2 shows up he really knows how to make you laugh until you drop to the floor crying becuase you are laughing so hard. He has that sense of knowing how people work and he knows that a smile and a laugh could turn someones bad day into a fantastic day. @CAPS1 is the greatest thing someone could ask for and when every one is together it only makes the time sweeter, now add a laugh, a few smiles and you have yourself a great time! My @CAPS2 has so many jokes and corny lines that he can use to to try and make somebody laugh but its not just what he says that makes it so funny, it is the timeing in which he does it. I wish to learn from him and use his people skills to return the favor and help people have a better day just by sharing a good laugh and put a bit smile on there face becuase not only does it make them feel good but it also can make yourself feel better knowing that you just helped somebody else have a better day just by telling a small joke or saying something funny that got there attention enough, and you never know taht person could one day turn back and remember what you did for them and tell somebody else and then it's a domino affect. He/she will tell somebody about what happened it and they will make somebody else's day better just by a small and simple laugh.  Most friendships and relationships start with laughter because one of you had the confidence to break the ice with one another, sometimes thats all it takes to start a friendship that will last a lifetime. So every one can share a good laugh, it doesn't matter who you are or where you come from everybody is subject to a ""hoot and a holler"" every now and then. When I met now my best friend who is like a brother to me, it all started with a joke that brought a smile to both of our faces and an unforgetable laugh. From that day to now we are the best of friends that life could have handed us, so all it takes is for you to want to really go out and just be yourself and make somebody laugh.  Laughter is the greatest thing in life that people need to do every day to keep their spirits high and lively no matter the circumstances that your in. The military has to go to war and live in an hostile inviroment but they still find time to sit down as a unit and share a drink and luagh about something. It is in our blood to enjoy life so don't try to avoid people or the luaghter that wants to come out. When your having a terrible day the best thing to do is go to a buddies house and just hang out becuase the people that truely care about you will find a way to enliven your spirit and make you laugh which will bring a smile to your face and whole new start to the day, it's like a refreshment for your body. When i am having a bad day all i have to do is think about something that me and a friend did that was funny and it will bring either a smile across my face or laugh coming out and sometimes both. Laughter is the key to life becuase it can turn anything negative into a positive. When you go to a party with @CAPS1 or friends do you sit in the back and think about nothing, no you get up and have a great time with your friends and always end sharing a good laugh with somebody.  I believe with all my heart that laughter is not just the key to life but the key to the inside a person, it shows who they are becuase nobody can hide or shake the want to laugh at something funny, it's just not possible for somebody to do. Laughter comes from the heart and the soul inside a person and those two things alone are very powerful and when they want to sing and rejoice which comes out as laughter you can't deny the need. When two or more people are gathered the ability to create an enviroment where anyone can be themselves and enjoy the laugh not just fake it it what every person looks for so when someone said this, it is so true ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people""."	32
21351	"Have you ever seen the phrase @CAPS1,@CAPS2,Laughter? Have you ever asked yourself what it means? I believe it can mean many different things for many different people. There are some people that can take it negativly andthen there's some that take it positivley i believe that those @NUM1 words in that phrase are everything you need to have a perfect life. A perfect life isn't about having the best car the most expensive clothes or the nicest physical appearence. Im going to tell you why laughter is very important in any kind of relationship. Im @NUM2 years old now but i was @NUM3 when i met the person who makes me laugh no matter the situation. He is a male tall, brown skin. He is @NUM4 years old now. but he was @NUM2 when i met him.It all started at school thats where we met. He always made me laugh i remember once i was very upset because i was having some issues at home and being with him was something i needed to actually forget what was going on he is a very honest person and thats what was good about him he would make any situation into a joke. even emberassing things that either happend to me or him he would turn them around to the piont where i wouldn't feel emberassed anymore. I @CAPS1 it how i can be myself with him. He was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster. @NUM1 years have gone by and i am now married with that best friend that i had and we have two beautiful twin daughets together and i @CAPS2 my life to the fullest because he makes me happy. Instead of arguing its laughter and life is just better that way not only it makes me laugh but thats what makes him a good person and other people feel good around him. Laughter not only is good in a male and female relationship but it is also good in a female and female relationship. I have a best friend. not only is she my best friend because she's honest, and kind but because she's funny she makes me laugh we can laugh at the simplist things ever most people @MONTH1 think we are crazy, we aren't that just the sound of a happy life. I believe a life without laughter is like a straight road boring and long. life with laughter is like a curvey road you just dont know what to expect. My mother and I have a pretty solid relationship we do alot of things together but what i enjoy most is the laughs we have sometimes when something occurs at that momment it might be downhill but a year from that day you look back and its funny its always better to enojy laughing with somebody that you can consider dear to you. Laughing at the memmories is what i enjoy most with anyone because that memory you will always carry with you and sooner or later you are going to laugh at the fact that it happend, when and where. So when ever something happens to you that you @MONTH1 consider emberassing look back at it a year from that day im sure you will get a laugh or atleast a smile out of it. "	31
21357	"Laughter is an amazing feeling. @CAPS1 feel good, @CAPS1 feel wonderful, happy, secure, and loved. It is what brings the best out of people, in my opinion. People laugh to show a sense of humor, and to show love. I am more of a depressed person, and my therepst always told me,  ""@CAPS1 don't want wrinkles, so smile, and laugh it out.""I predict that laughing is what makes people who they really are. When @CAPS1 are mad, or even sad. What do @CAPS1 want to do? I don't think @CAPS1 would want to be grouchy all day? I would think @CAPS1 would want your friends or family make @CAPS1 laugh, so @CAPS1 can get over what your upset about, move on and be happy. In life, nothing is more important than love, and laughter. There is no love with no laughter. No laughter without love. We need one another to keep our days going. Especially for those who have been through a lot in life. Like me. I have family problems, I'm a sophomore, yet I am still standing tall with a bright smile on my face. I know, that everything will be @CAPS2 fine, @CAPS4 I @CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes me feel safe, makes me feel like, I am needed in this world. I ve have been through so much, that others look up to me. Wwhen it comes to that, I know exactly @CAPS2 what to do. Make them laugh. Nothing stands out more beautiful than a human laughing. A lot of people has always wondered how I could be so strong, because of all the horrible situations I have been through since middle school. Aand I tell them, ""@CAPS2 laugh it out. It makes @CAPS1 feel way better in the end."" I mean, @CAPS1 @MONTH1 feel silly when your done laughing, but also feel great. That @CAPS1 can @CAPS2 laugh, and move on. Because it is life. Notihng is perfect, things will get messed up, people come and go. There will be tears, and there will be laughter. When it comes to an end, let it go. Laugh, and @CAPS2 be happy that he/she was once yours. Memories last forever, cherish every moment @CAPS1 have, laugh and live life as it is, because it is too short to waste time, and frown. Laughter is the beauty of a person's voice. Some are high, and some are low. Some are loud, some are very quiet, and giggly.I have a loud mouth. Also a loud laugh. I am very tiny, yet the volume that comes out of me when I laugh makes @CAPS3 so surprised. I entertain people with my laugh, depending on my mood, my laugh will change tone. Sometimes @CAPS1 can say my laugh is annoying, but I'm not afraid to laugh. I'm not, so don't be afraid, speak out, and like text messages that @CAPS3 sends to eachother, laugh out loud. Everything will be okay. It takes a lot of strength to make me stop laughing. Because I am a ""blonde."" @CAPS3 says. No matter what, I'll always be laughing. In fourth grade my teacher once said,  ""@CAPS4 @CAPS1 laugh a lot. @CAPS1 will live life longer.""I still remember it from then on, I still, and will believe in that quote. Laughter is what makes me who I am today, and it has made me become a better, and stronger person. The most common thing that people do is laugh. @CAPS1 can walk down the hall, in the mall, next door, outside, at a park, where ever else. There will always be people lauhging, and sharing jokes all over the world. I'm glad people can speak through laughter."	41
21365	" People say ""laughter can cure anything"", @CAPS6 you know what I totally believe it to. There has been multiple times when I was sad or angry that someone made me laugh, and I have made almost everyone I know laugh when they were down our frustrated. Now, many people have made me laugh throughout my whole sixteen years that i have been alive. To be completely honest, I only really remember one moment in my life that really laughter was all I needed to pull me back to reality. My best friend @PERSON2 really knew what i need to help me out. her humor made my life real again, and because of it I was able to except life. It was @DATE1, when I got really upset because I knew that the guy I loved since seventh grade wouldn't date me again. His reason for this was because he didn't want to ruin our great and close friendship. Just because he said that didn't mean I would just give up. I tried @CAPS2 to win him back, but it just seemed like nothing was working. At this point I knew I needed to talk to my best friend, so I text-ed @PERSON2. I told her @CAPS2 I was doing, and how none of it was working. If you knew @PERSON2, you would know that @CAPS1 sees a bright side to anything @PERSON2 told me at that time, ""@PERSON1, you can have any guy ion the world, and yet, you can't seem to realize it. I don't know about you, but you must be really @CAPS3 sick!"" @CAPS1 said that once or twice because @CAPS1 knew it was true. I still just couldn't except what @CAPS1 was telling me. that never stopped me from smiling or laughing though. I'll admit those words really dried my tears up. and helped me move forward. Now it is @DATE2 time, school is out, and it's time for me to step my game up. I was still trying to win @PERSON3, the @CAPS3 of my life back. Once again I tried @CAPS2! I even asked @PERSON2 to ask @PERSON3 if he still had feelings for me. He never gave her an answer. When I asked @PERSON2 for more advice, @CAPS1 responded like usual. ""@PERSON1, @PERSON3 is just one guy, there are plenty of guys out there for you. You just need to look and stop trying for just one guy"". This got me thinking. @CAPS6 @CAPS1 is totally right, I just need to find a guy that makes me feel the same way @PERSON3 makes me feel. Don't get me wrong though, even though @PERSON2 was trying to be serious, I couldn't help but smile a little, and giggle. As I was giggling, I though t to myself. I still @CAPS3 @PERSON3 like crazy. It's the beginning of @DATE2, and I am just relaxing at my house like usual, when I get a text from @PERSON3 saying he might be moving to @LOCATION1. I just started bawling like a baby who is hungry. I quickly text ed @PERSON2 to tell her, but @CAPS1 already knew. I had one more plan to win @PERSON3 back, and I told @PERSON2 all about it. My plan is to ask @PERSON3 if he wants to hike @CAPS4. Pisqah with me before he moves. When we hiked all the way to the top I am going to tell him how I truly still feel about him, then I am going to kiss him.m @CAPS5 @PERSON2 read this, her first response was, "" @CAPS6 shoot girly, aren't you just a spitball of @CAPS3 and romance!"" I almost peed my pants when I read that. It was hysterical! My plan never happened because @PERSON3 ended up not moving thankfully. Quintin and I still haven't got back together, but I am fine with that. His and I's friendship has grown tremendously. I'll admit though that I can't help but flirt with him a lot. Luckily though, I had my best friend @PERSON2 to talk to. @CAPS1 is the reason my tears and moans turned to tears of happiness and laughter. @PERSON2's humor brought me to except-ants. laughter kept me in perspective of @CAPS2. I owe all my thanks to @PERSON2, who kept me from going insane or crazy about @CAPS2. Laughter helped mend my heart, and change my whole life dramatically. "	37
21373	" In the ninth grade I was required to give a speech about a book. The speech was to be persuasive, like a television or radio advertisement. I am awful at giving speeches. Before speeches my hands get clammy and cold, I experience ""hot flashes,"" and occasionally get nauseous. During speeches my eyes frantically glance around the room, my breathing pattern changes to quick short breathes. Almost in sync with my glances. At the end of my speeches I begin shaking and am nearly in a state of shock. I do not speak, I do not laugh, and I feel like hiding. Luckily, @CAPS4 speech was different. My @CAPS1 class had all girls and one boy. Not to say I am sexist, but having the majority of the room being female did help. Girls have a way of acceptance, or at least creating a facade of acceptance, and that does make me feel relaxed and calmer.  So when the time came for me to stand up in front of the room nearly everyone in the class had a slight smile of ambition and readiness to listen to what I had to say. Everyone was making eye contact with me. Compared to the average classroom setting of ""speech giving time,"" (when people are doodling or mouthing words to each other) the classroom was zoned in on me. Today @CAPS5 felt like everyone was ready to hear me no matter what I really had to say, and how professional @CAPS5 came out. I felt superior, as if I had the power to alter their lives, almost so superior that I could spit propaganda at them and they would eat @CAPS5 up (@CAPS2't that what advertisment is? Telling a group of people the good things about a product or idea, and hiding the bad things?). The group looked so innocent. Today I was ready to give my speech, just because of that spark of acceptance, and a smile. I began. My speech was told with puppets with a cardboard box around @CAPS5 to serve the purpose of a television. @CAPS4 also made me feel better because all the audience saw was my puppets and all they heard was the voices of the ""actors."" @CAPS3 the first few lines of the speech my group of classroom peers laughed, @CAPS4 was not what they had expected. I am a shy, quiet girl who barely has the courage to raise her hand in class. I wear things like semi-large coats to set a barrier between myself and the world. A lot of times when I give speeches people laugh, but usually a negative laugh. The kind of laugh that the teacher has to hush everyone. @CAPS5's also the kind of laugh that makes me cut my speech shorter, that just makes the speech a introduction and an ending, bodiless. So for me to break out of my shell was a big step in what most think of as the correct direction. The sound of @CAPS4 laughter coaxed me to continue forward with my speech.  At the end of my speech everyone clapped. They always clap. @CAPS5 is required to clap. @CAPS4 clap was different, @CAPS5 was clapping for the success of the speaker, a clap that said ""@CAPS4 speech had a clear purpose, and made the audience want to keep listening."" @CAPS5 was not a pity clap. Then I smiled. My smile represented that I knew I had succeeded. That I had gotten a group of people together and focused on hearing what I had to say, and that they had comprehended @CAPS5, and maybe that they would now want to read the book. @CAPS4 was one of the first speeches I had ever met all of the requirements on. The length of the speech was good, not long enough to make the audience fall asleep and not quick enough for them to forget the true purpose of the speech. I enunciated all of my words so everyone could understand what I was saying, @CAPS4 was a definite improvement, and also a factor of why they laughed. They could hear my witty jokes and comments. Lastly, my puppets also had a introduction, body, and conclusion to their babble. Usually I get so nervous I forget to say the body of the speech. Laughter can be mean, cruel and disrespectful. My speech story is an example of how laughter can effect people positively. The laughter of the audience was cheery, happy, encouraging, and accepting."	40
21380	" When I was fourteen years old I think my family and I started riding four wheelers out in the sand. My parents friends are the one who got us started riding. The first time I went out there I had a @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION2 four wheeler and i couldn't stop laughing because it was so small and everybody had big four wheelers and dirt bikes, but riding out there with that thing was fun and my family would laugh every time my brother rode it up a hill because he would just ride the crap out of that thing. After that ride we sold my four wheeler and got a @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION1. Its the first time going to the dunes with my new four wheeler and I can't wait. We get to the dunes unload everything get our riding gear on and our helmets with our goggles on. It was thirty minutes of riding and my brother was jumping his four wheeler when some people showed up and was video taping him, which made him show off a little bit. So he was jumping in front of those people going further and further every time. My family couldn't stop smiling and laughing because he was showing up everybody there who was trying to out jump him. So when he got don't jumping the guys who were video taping him came up to us and they told us that he is really good and that we should follow them to another jump.So my brother trying to be cool whipped his bike around and wrecked it was funny my dad and I were laughing so hard our eyes were tearing up but lucky for him my dad and I were the only ones to see his little crash. So we went to go see if hes okay and he said yea so we took off. My brother and I were right behind them and our parents were no where in sight. I turned my head to look and see if they were behind us and when I look ahead of me all I see is a roost of sand in my face, which made me turn my handle bars so I hit a grass mound and the bike flew up in the air rolled off a little little hill and landed on my leg, my brother didn't knew he did that to me so I was stranded until my parents came. I don't know why but i couldn't stop laughing because believe it or not that wreck was actually kinda fun and funny because no matter what I did I couldn't seem to get that four wheeler off my leg.  About ten minutes passed by with my four wheeler on my leg and I finally heard a loud noise it was my dad and he came to save me so I told him what happened and he couldn't stop laughing at me. He told me he would get my brother back. So when we were on our way back to the truck my brother was behind my dad and my dad roosted him with sand so bad it made his goggles fall off! My parents and I couldn't stop laughing and we ended up pulling over so we could stop laughing at my brother. After that my brother doesn't roost me anymore.  It's been a year since we have started riding and still my brother has not yet roosted me. He still tends to show off. This one time my moms friends came out and my brother was trying to be cool and ride really fast from coming out of the dunes and he slid on the concrete and he wrecked in front of us and maybe like seven people, it was hilarious everybody was laughing besides my mom. He looked at his arm and he had road rash all down his arm. Well I guess that's what he gets for trying to show off. It's like every time he tries to show off he wrecks, so why does he keep doing it? I don't know why but maybe he should stop sometime so he doesn't wreck every time we go out there. Just kidding it doesn't bother me when he wrecks because they are usually funny. I thinks that's why we have so much fun out there because of him."	37
21386	" During the @DATE1 of the sixth grade @CAPS4 parents decided they were getting a divorce. I got the phone call when I was at @CAPS4 best friend @PERSON1's house.   ""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 father"" @CAPS4 @CAPS5 said through the phone to me.   ""@CAPS6 @CAPS5, @CAPS8's @CAPS9?"" I asked him.   ""@CAPS10 need to come home, @CAPS10 @CAPS18 has served me today with divorce papers."" @CAPS12 told me. I could feel the tears starting to swell @CAPS9 in @CAPS4 eyes. I had no clue @CAPS8 was happening, I was only @NUM1 and vaguely knew @CAPS8 divorce was. Without saying a word to him, I hung @CAPS9 the phone and ran into @PERSON1's room. I knew that the divorce would change things for me, but I didn't realize to @CAPS8 extent.   I stayed at @LOCATION1's house for the next two weeks. There was no way I was going home. I didn't want to see @CAPS4 @CAPS18 or @CAPS4 father. At night I drempt about @CAPS8 @CAPS4 sisters were going through, the horror that they had to endure while I was away. I wondered @CAPS8 @CAPS4 father was doing, where @CAPS4 @CAPS18 was, and whether or not @CAPS4 sisters were @CAPS13. Even though I knew I should have gone home at one point during those two weeks, I didn't.  During those two weeks at @LOCATION1's house, I felt safe and secure, but not once did I feel happy. It was an emotion that I had longed for, but all the times that I tried to smile, tried to laugh, tried to be myself, I couldn't. I knew that something had changed in me when I hung @CAPS9 the phone on @CAPS4 father. I had never hung @CAPS9 on anyone before. It was something that I knew I shouldn't have done, but I was so upset, I did it anyways.  When @CAPS4 @CAPS18 came to pick me @CAPS9 after @CAPS4 two week extended stay at @LOCATION1's, she looked at me with concern in her eyes. I had never seen this emotion in @CAPS4 @CAPS18 before. She usually was so calm and in control. I had never seen her so concerned or upset. I knew that she was concerned for me. I also knew that @PERSON1's @CAPS14 had called mine several times during @CAPS4 stay. I assume she told her about how I was acting, but @CAPS8 was I supposed to do? @CAPS4 parents were splitting @CAPS9! @CAPS4 whole life was being flushed down the toilet. I knew that nothing would ever be the same and it killed me inside.  No one spoke on the ride home. I could feel the tension building as we turned onto @CAPS4 street and drove towards @CAPS4 house. When we pulled into the driveway, I got out of the car and ran to @CAPS4 room, leaving @CAPS4 things on the back seat of the sedan. For two days, I didn't eat or sleep. I just laid in @CAPS4 bed longing for @CAPS4 father to come home. I had never gone to bed without @CAPS4 father tucking me in, never woke @CAPS9 in the @TIME1 on @CAPS4 own. There were so many things that @CAPS4 father did that @CAPS12 wasn't there to do anymore.  Things didn't start to get better until @CAPS4 @CAPS18 sent me and @CAPS4 sisters to @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house in @LOCATION2. I don't know why, but when I was there, I felt that same sense of safeness and security that I felt when I was at @LOCATION1's house. Even though I felt safe and secure, it still wasn't the same. It had been several weeks since I had visited @PERSON1, and I was dying to go back to her house. I knew that that was the only place that I could actually recover from @CAPS8 was happening. @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house was nice and all, but it didn't feel like home, I didn't think that anywhere I stayed would feel right. All I knew is that I needed @CAPS4 @CAPS5, not @CAPS4 @CAPS17 or @CAPS4 @CAPS18, just @CAPS4 @CAPS5, and maybe @PERSON1.  When I came home from @CAPS4 @CAPS15 house, I made arrangements to go over to @LOCATION1 house. I knew that I would be staying awhile, so I packed extra. When I got there, I told her about @CAPS8 was going on and how @CAPS4 sisters were doing. On the night that I arrived, we decided that we would go to the river the next day. I thought it was an alright idea. The next day we went to the river, her brothers decided to join us. Her brother @PERSON2 wanted to prove to us how much of a man @CAPS12 was, so @CAPS12 jumped off of the largest rock at the river. I thought it would be a perfect cannon ball, but it wasn't. @CAPS12 landed on his stomach for the perfect belly flop. I couldn't contain myself, I burst out laughing, I don't think i stopped laughing for several minutes. It was by far the best day I had since the day @CAPS4 father called me at @LOCATION1's house."	42
21391	" I have been waiting a whole year for @TIME1 day to come, @DATE1. Today is my birthday! I just cant wait to open presents and eat cake. I am turning @NUM1 and all my friends are coming over and everything. It should be a great day! First I have to wait for my mom to @CAPS2 home from work. So today I am going to go swimming then going to go on a hike then finally my friends can come over and the party we start. We will have games, presents and cake. My mom said my sister were automatically invited but I dont like that rule. Maybe next birthday @CAPS1 can uninvited them.  My mom is at work. She left at @TIME1 and me and my sister just ate breakfast now we are going to go swimming. We have a pool right beside the patio in the front yard. Sometimes when my sister is mad she just throws me in. Other times she just does it because she is bigger then me and she can. My older sister @PERSON1 friend @PERSON2 was spending the week with us because she had moved away over the @DATE2 and decided she would come visit. Thats when they decided to start throwing me in the pool. One would always grab my legs the other would grab my arms and they would swing me until they just t threw me in the pool. well I got mad after it kept happening and threw a fit and cried. @PERSON1 told me if i was going to acting like a baby then i deserved to be treated like one, so she put me in a diaper and in the highchair and forced me to eat baby food. Of course I was crying now because I do not like baby food and to be in a highchair or be put in a diaper.  By @TIME1 time i didnt want to go on a hike and was just wanting my mom to be home. Finally my mom was home and even better she brought pizza. I was so excited that she did because all my friends were coming over and pizza was perfect.My mom change out of her work clothes then she decided it was time for me to take a nap. well I am @NUM1 i dont need a nap so thats when knew something was up. now that I decided it was @CAPS3 I went and took a nap and actually really did fall asleep. my mom at @TIME1 time cleaned, decorated and went and got all my friends. when i woke up and walked out of the living room mom and all my friends screamed ""surprise"" and I was definitely surprised. After a long fun party it was time that we cleaned up and put all the garbage away and the cake in the over so no flies would @CAPS2 to it. The next day my mom went back to work and I swam and played all day! It was a great day got to wear my new swim suit and got to also play with my new floaty toys I got. I got a lot of @DATE2 stuff. then, me and my little sister @PERSON3 were trying to find a way to @CAPS2 hot water into the pool but we were having trouble because the house didnt fit to the faucet at the bathroom. so thats when we went to my moms room and used the bathtub and put the hose all the way out the back door. We definitely accomplished that mission! By @TIME1 time we heard a lot of craziness and I went to go see what was going on and it was smoky all over. I went into the kitchen and my sister yelled"" @CAPS2 your sisters and @CAPS2 out of the house meet you at the road"" I ran and got them and then i saw fire trucks speeding up the drive way and here comes my mom racing over and she was freaking out making sure everyone was @CAPS3.  In the end I found out that she had burn my birthday cake trying to preheat the over for pizza. I was kinda upset that it was burnt but now I am @CAPS3 with it because I look back and laugh because my sister to @TIME1 day still has the burnt spoon and the lock. the lock is from our gate it was a simple dummy lock and the fire fighters didnt know so they just cut the chains. I guess the lesson learned here is that before you preheat the over you should always make sure nothing is in there."	34
21398	"                                         ""@CAPS1 to @CAPS2"" @CAPS3 you ever seen the little signs that say, ""@CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS2""? People often @CAPS3 them in their homes as a reminder on how one should @CAPS4 their life. Well, I believe that laughing is one of the most important elements you need, in order to @CAPS4 your life to the fullest. Laughter keeps the soul young, the heart happy, and the spirit joyful. Without laughter, one @MONTH1 feel that they @CAPS3 an emptiness inside that they are unable to fill. Laughter has played a huge role in my life and has created some of the best memories. If luaghter was not a part of me, my life would be like a house without furniture; empty, boring, and over all, pointless. Some memories will never leave my mind, and looking back, I still @CAPS2 my brains out. My favorite, and most hilarious memory that I can think of, occurred about two years ago at my grandparents house. My family and I were staying with my grandparents for the weekend up at their house in @CAPS7, which I absolutely loved because there was so much to do there! They had go-carts, golf carts, acreage, and a gigantic swimming pool! What more could someone want? The weather was always nice and warm as well, so I had no complaints. It was a beautiful evening, my brother, his best friend, and I decided to take the golf carts out for a spin. My brother was in his own golf cart zooming by, and I was in one with his friend @PERSON1. Now, @ORGANIZATION1 must @CAPS3 seen something in the road because he told me to stop, then he hopped out. As he curiously made his way to the front of the golf cart, I pressed gently on the gas inching forward in a sort of fast manner just to scare him a little. As I did that, he frantically jumped on the hood like a cat that had just been frightened. I then decided to slam on the brakes, and when that happened, @PERSON1 launched off like a rocket, but then tried to hop back on the hood. I guess you could say we developed a game. I would go a few inches or so, then slam on the brakes! At that point I was practically crying from laughing so hard. That is until something very unexpected happened...I drove fast, and then stopped very quickly, but as i did so, this time @PERSON1 tripped! I didn't notice because I was carelessly driving like a maniac, but soon enough the golf cart was on top of him! All I remember hearing was a @CAPS8 @CAPS9! and then a loud shrilll. He was laying face first, cart on his back, and I had no idea what to do! My heart quickly sped up, and a gust of fear came over me. I looked to my right to find my brother rolling around on his back laughing like a hyena! I was still sitting in the golf cart, still unable to move in my state of shock. My brother finally got up and @PERSON1 was yelling, ""@CAPS10't move @CAPS11!"" @CAPS12 I had to do something! My brother was trying to tell me that we should lift the heavy cart from his back but in my head, I knew that both of us together wouldn't @CAPS3 been able to do that. Taking matters into my own hands, I shifted into reverse very carefully and slowly. Biting down on my lower lip, closing my eyes tightly, I pounded the gas to the ground, flying backwards off of his helpless body. Luckily no damage was done, and @ORGANIZATION1 was perfectly fine. A gigantic weight was lifted from my back and I was able to breathe again. Looking back, I am able to @CAPS2 and joke about that wonderful day that went so wonderfully wrong, though I am very thankful that nothing extremely harmful happened to the poor guy I dreadfully ran over that day. I can tell you one thing, as the day carried on, we had a blast. Carelessly being the great teenagers we are, and without a worry in the world; we laughed, swam, drove the golf carts, and enjoyed the wind swooping our hair up, then down, then all around. I take back two things from this crazy day. One, make smart decisions, and be prepared for the consequences that you @MONTH1 be faced with, and two, enjoy your life. @CAPS2 like there's no tomorrow. Be careless yet careful, and enjoy every second of it! I've learned that when faced with a tough decision; for example...do I roll off of my brothersfriend? or do I continue to sit here and listen to him yell? In that case I took a big leap of faith, and went with my gut instinct. Which I believe was most definitley the right decision. Go with your gut instinct in life, and @CAPS1 to @CAPS2."	50
21407	"The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I think of laughter I think of my @CAPS2, of all the things that got me rolling on the ground with no breath left in my lungs, enjoying the life that @CAPS4 gave me. We all know that most children find absolutely everything funny. @CAPS3 I was about ten my parents bought my siblings and I a puppy. This was no ordinary puppy, it was the runt of the litter, and it had some kind of mental disorder. Oh, how we loved that puppy. Every day @CAPS3 I got home from school I would go in the back yard and play with the puppy for hours and hours. We finally found a name for @CAPS10 a few days later; his name was @CAPS5. The reason we named @CAPS10 @CAPS5 was because @CAPS9 would literally tip over while just walking.  One day @CAPS3 I got home from school I took @CAPS5 to the top of the hill in our back yard, I was playing with @CAPS10 and running around and laughing. Every time @CAPS5 would run down the hill his little legs would get tangled up and @CAPS9 would nose dive and start tumbling down the hill until @CAPS9 could get back up again, which normally wasn't until @CAPS9 was at the bottom of the hill. @CAPS3 @CAPS9 did that my sister and I would laugh so hard because it was so cute and we just loved it! As children we lived life for the moment, and enjoyed our lives. I think that we still need to do that now. We need laughter and @CAPS1 in our lives, we need to focus on the positive and not dwell on the negative. The laughter of your @CAPS2 should carry on through the rest of your life. @CAPS4 has blessed us with so much, @CAPS9 has given us more than we give @CAPS10 credit for. Laugh for the moment, take @CAPS1 in the small things in life, embrace the amazing creation set before you, and love others like @CAPS4 loves you, because you never know @CAPS3 your time on this earth is over."	40
21412	" embarrassing laughterHave you ever thought some thing was really funny where you felt like you where going to pee your pants? Or have you felt like the side of your stomach was going to explode because you where laughing @CAPS1 hard? well this happened to me it was all @CAPS1 crazy like a dream it was during my @NUM1 grad @DATE1 to be exact. My brother @PERSON3 and my friend @PERSON1 and i where walking through the park minding are own bissness just trying to have a good time. My brother was talking to @LOCATION1 about this really funny joke that he herd at school i don't remember the joke but i do remember how funny it was because i nearly peed my pants it was @CAPS1 embarrassing but at the same time funny i don't no why though. @CAPS1 i told them if they don't stop telling each other jokes i might pee my pants. But of cores what any brother would do is just keep on going they thought it was just @CAPS1 funny well not me i thought it was mean and painful if you no what i mean because i had a full balder. My friend @PERSON1 the sweet, loving person she is suggested to go find a bathroom, @CAPS1 off we went on the mission to find a bathroom @PERSON3 my brother said ""well i believe that there is a bathroom up this hill lets check it out and see if it is open @CAPS1 @PERSON2 can go to the bathroom"". little did we no that it was @DATE2 and the bathrooms where closed for the workers to come in and clean.when we mad it all the way up the hill i latterly ran to the bathroom i never felt this way before it was just @CAPS1 painful i could not put it into words.soon enough i found out the doors where locked i was @CAPS1 mad and devastated. @PERSON3 and @ORGANIZATION1 thought it was funny because i had to pee really bad and the bathroom was close they where laughing @CAPS1 hard, but i got tired of hearing them @CAPS1 i ditched them to go find the closes bathroom sadly it was a mile away that mad me @CAPS1 mad i wanted to cry. But of course that would get me no where! this is what i sad in my head ""that means i need to run"". I ran back up the hill a crossed the bridge and tors the nearest store as possible. FINALLY!!!

21418	" Laughter is an interesting emotion. It's one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous. This, however, isn't always the case. Some people laugh when they're embarrassed or uncomfortable. Others, when they're enraged and upset. And then, there are people who laugh when they are grieving or sad. People don't expect that to happen. To laugh when you are depressed. It is strange but true. I know this from personal experience, which led up to one of the most tragic events of my short life.  I was about nine. The age @CAPS4 you're hyper and energetic almost nonstop. I had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door. My mom was waiting for @CAPS3 inside. ""@CAPS1 on @CAPS2,"" she said. ""We're going to see your grandparents for a few hours."" I was upset. I was not only tired and hungry, but I had to drive almost an hour away to see my grandparents. So I did what any nine year old would do. I cried, whined and pleaded her not to go. She didn't listen of course. She toned @CAPS3 out, waited until I was out of air, and then picked @CAPS3 up and tossed @CAPS3 in the car.  Isn't taking a nap great? That's exactly what I did on the ride over. I was clapped-out, so I felt it was alright to have a little ""@CAPS3"" time. When we got to their house, I had just woken up and didn't feel like moving. I had to force myself to get up and say hello. It was depressing, yet fascinating really. Seeing your grandparents is like seeing a glimpse of the future. In the sense that you know what your going to look like when you're old. They had candy though, which was tasty and mouth-watering. We actually stayed for quite a few hours. My mom called my dad a couple of times asking if we could go home, but we never did. She just had a conversation with my grandparents while I watched television. At last, my dad finally called to say we could @CAPS1 home. We said goodbye and booked it before it was too dark out. By the time we got home, it was pitch-black outside. We still hadn't eaten yet and I was starving. I jumped out of the car and walked over to the gate that separated the front yard from the back. I shook the gate, expecting three delighted dogs to run up and start jumping on the gate wanting to play. Instead, only two showed. ""@CAPS4's @CAPS5?"" I wondered. I thought he was most likely eating or sleeping so I decided to just go inside and eat. When I opened the door to the house, both of my parents were standing in the entry way. I could tell they were trying to hold back tears. Then it hit @CAPS3 like a ton of bricks. ""@CAPS5 passed away,"" my mom said. I froze. I didn't believe them. I couldn't. My best friend in the world was gone. I cried for hours, possibly more. I didn't know what to do. Then something weird happened. I started to laugh. I don't know why I did. Maybe it's because I wanted to try to cheer myself up. Or maybe, I realized he was in a better place. To this day I still feel an empty space in my heart @CAPS4 my best friend once was. I still think about why I laughed that day. I think about why we laugh in general. Whether it's when you're happy, angry, or even sad, we laugh to try to get by and make the best of both good and bad situations. As tragic as the situation was, I can't help but feel happy. My best friend was in pain and could barely walk, so we had to euthanize him. I knew it was the right thing to do, and quite frankly, I don't think I would have felt better if I hadn't laughed that night. It was awkward at first. It felt wrong and terrible, but it helped @CAPS3 more than I could have ever anticipated."	45
21425	" Many people say that the people who laugh more live longer. I remember when I was ten years old, I was going to learn how to ride a bike. Little did I know it was going to be a hard task. My brother said I didn't need training wheels. Although I was scared, looking at other kids ride their bikes made me gather up courage to learn how to ride a bike.  It was the big day, it was a perfect day to learn how to ride a bike. As I walked down the stairs all geared up and ready I began to feel @LOCATION1. I went outside, my big brother was waiting for me. He had a helmet and the bike, he began to go over the basic rules. Slowly I started to get on the bike, I was confident I could do it.  Next it was time to gear up and put my helmet on. My heart was pounding, I could feel my blood going through my veins. Giving the first peddle I fell and hit the ground extremely hard. All I wanted to do was run home and cry on my moms lap. I looked up at my brother, he asked me if I was okay. Up until this day I can remember laughing instead of crying, after all crying wasn't going to make the pain go away nor teach me how to ride a bike.  Finally, I got back on that bike and peddled and peddled. I can remember my brother telling me that laughter is the best medicine around. I was laughing as a peddled, sometimes I think that maybe laughter is what made me accomplish my goal to learn how to ride a bike. in my life laughing and smiling and having fun is a big deal. You can't always take laugh too seriously."	34
21431	" Laughter plays an important role in everyone's lives. Different laughs represent various things. For instance, have @CAPS2 ever heard someone chuckle and know right away that they are being sarcastic, or maybe even sympathetic? A laugh can say a lot. I'm going to tell @CAPS2 about the time my friend fell into an @NUM1 pond.  In early @DATE1, my friend was visiting me at my house for a week. The third morning of her stay, we woke up and it had snowed seven inches @TIME1. I was used to the soft, white flakes spiraling through the air, @CAPS1 @CAPS1 was from @LOCATION1 and had never seen snow before. As my friend was listing all of the things @CAPS1 wanted to do that day, @CAPS1 let out the most anxious laugh I had ever heard. I could tell @CAPS1 just wanted to go outside that very moment. Of course @CAPS1 knew it was going to be cold but I didn't think @CAPS1 knew how cold. I told her it was going to be chillier than what @CAPS1 might be expecting.  We got dressed in numerous layers of clothing: socks, pants, shirts, and jackets so we could head out. As we were walking down the snowy hill @CAPS1 spotted the @NUM1 pond on the lower half of my property and hurled towards it. @CAPS1 asked if we could go swimming, I laughed a sarcastic laugh and answered, ""heck no!"" @CAPS1 walked toward a massive log that lays across the water and decided to cross it. @CAPS1 said that if I didn't go with her @CAPS1 would push me in. So I took a step back, @CAPS1 just looked down and continued walking. As @CAPS1 stepped onto the log that was glazed with ice @CAPS1 got a little cocky and decided to jump around to show me it was ""fun."" I laughed at the funny movements @CAPS1 was making and whispered, ""@CAPS2're going to fall."" All of a sudden @CAPS1 slipped and the ice cracked. It reminded me of glass shattering on a cement floor. This picture in front of me was almost as if it was in slow motion; I can remember her hands reaching up to grasp the log before @CAPS1 fell in to the freezing water. @CAPS1 fell through, I bounded @TIME1 to help her out, I slowly pulled her out of the pond. I looked at her after I had harpooned onto the log and we both burst out in laughter...although her teeth were chattering and her multiple layers of clothing we soaked, I knew @CAPS1 was @CAPS3 going to cherish this moment because it was her first snow experience.  Walking up to the house @CAPS1 giggled, ""I should have listened to @CAPS2 huh?"" I nodded my head and suggested we take off her clothes to ring out and put in the dryer.We changed into pajamas and sipped on hot chocolate and coffee all day long, sharing laughter and smiles. I will @CAPS3 remember this day because there were so many different stories I can tell from it."	40
21437	" Laughter is the most important part when you meet other people. Even a light smile can change the image of whole person. Sometimes, people practice their laughter to get better image of themselves. I believe that every people contain their own personality in their laughter. How you laugh is the way to express how you feel. For example, you can tell you are not comfortable by chuckling nervously, or you can tell it wasn't actually funny sarcastically by laughing without any tone or emotions like a robot. You can tell lots of things with a laughter. Usually, friendships are made automatically when two people have something in common and agree with each other. And a laughter is the best way to agree with somebody else. As an @CAPS1, I had very hard time expressing my emotions with my laughter. As I know, many @CAPS2 people don't know that @CAPS1 can't smile as well as white people because their facial muscles are not very much developed. That's why other people think @CAPS4 are always angry and doesn't like humor. Thanks to that, I had lots of misunderstandings about my laughter. When I laugh, I don't look like I'm laughing which makes an unnatural laughter. When I first got here, it was in middle of semester and I couldn't speak @CAPS5 as well as I do now. I had no friends at all. It was a really hard job becoming a friend of someone without knowing what they know, or what their sense of humor is. In @LOCATION1, I usually made friends by making them laugh, but in here, I didn't know how to make them laugh. I had to listen to them quietly what they were laughing about, and I had to figure out what kind of sense of humor they had. Finally, when I made one friend, I still couldn't laugh. I didn't understand any of words what they were talking about. I didn't know when to laugh and where to laugh. It seems quite silly when I look back then right now, but I was really serious. I really missed @LOCATION1 where I had friends I can understand and laugh together. Living without sense of humor made me very depressed. I suddenly stopped laughing at all because I thought laughing alone would look stupid. I kept searching about this country's culture, and I tried to watch television more to learn what they have in their heads. And then, I finally understood those slang words they used and I could laugh when other laughed. I was really happy. I was so happy that I could make other people laugh. I made lots of friends and I laughed with them. But I still couldn't understand some of the language or some other things they laugh about, but I just laughed when they laughed. It made me feel I was one of them when I laughed with them, and I was really happy about it. There was a research about laughter and life, and it said that you live longer when you laugh more. They say that even fake laughter can fool your brain and it can be healthy. Then I saw a doctor who can cure people only by laughter. There are some groups of people who laugh together to be healthy. They gather around and starts laughing. It was really strange when I first saw that group on @CAPS6, but I saw people's effort to be healthy. I figured that fake laughter makes everyone happy, and laughter can cover every person's mistake. I also figured that there are still many ways to laugh in this world. By a small laughter, or even a fake laughter, we can make a better society and live a better life."	34
21443	" Every time I walk down the hall and I see a couple, they are either laughing with each other or doing other things that could disqualify my test. I know for a fact that the people that get voted cutest couple at our school are the ones that are laughing as opposed to the later. Not only does laughing create couples, then families, and eventually the next generation, but it creates friendships within schools, families, activites, etc. That's why personally I believe that laughing is the single most powerful action a person can do. Every person I am friends with have laughed with me and vice-versa. Especially one friend who I've gotten even closer since we met. I was very adament about going to church when I was young. I have always been shy and church allows me to be social with others without reticule. However I saw one girl sitting in the back corner who I felt was scared just like I probably would have been if it was anywhere else. My parents always wanted me to be more social and they said that one way to do that was to go out of my way to meet new people.  I did that for maybe the first time in my life to say ""hi"" to her. She replied by giving me her name. However I went back into my shy self and walked back terrified to talk to her or any one else again. However, I was only in third grade when all this happened so as time passed by things changed. About @NUM1 years after that a new church opened with a new class being open to children of all age groups. I had cemented myself into that classroom as one of two who regularly showed up. However this one day I was the only one who was there for my age group. Well actually I was the only one from my age group that was there on time. I saw a girl walking in with her dad who you could tell had forced her to go to the class. It took me a while to picture who it was but eventually I realized who it was. It was the girl who was scared to be in church and now she was the girl who was scared to be in class. She could clearly recognize me. I made a hand gesture telling her to come in. then you saw her smile. She shortly proceded to laughing a little bit. This was when I realized I met someone special. Now everytime I see her she smiles. That's how I know she will be a friend for a long time. Laughing can't be put into quotes, but it can be put into someone's memories for the rest of your life. I know this for a fact cause a lot of days have passed since and I still have these memories. Laughing is the easiest way to tell if a person is a true friend, something more, or should and will be forgotten."	34
21449	"One day my friend and I were waking up late in the day and his brother came in screaming and yelling at the top of his lungs ""bro bro""! This was the nickname he called him because he was only two years old, so my friend spencer calmed him down and we started watching t.v. We were talking about what we were going to do for the day so, we started throwing out ideas till we made one where we were going to swim later and play some games now. Spencers mom asked us when we were going to swim and that we had to take his little borther. So we went early so his little bro could swim and we could sit around and listen to music. Unlike everyone who uses an ipod I use my phone because then I can text and listen to music plus when someone calls it shuts off music so I'll know. It was a brand new phone too and i was loving every moment of having it. So when we dropped his little brother off we went back too the pool and sat in the hot tub for a while. I put my phone on my shirt and my towl over both so when spencer got out too use the towl he jerked the towl out and my phone flew up hit the ground slid on the floor all the way too the hot tub. That moment I look down and see it and freak I took it out ripped the back off and dried the battery with the towl hoping it would still work and it wouldn't stop dialing zero and nine so I took the battery out again. When we got back to his moms i plugged in the charger with no battery and spencer kept saying sorry and I kept answering ""its ok"". The next morning his mom asked why we didn't use a pot of rice and we started laughing because we freaked out so bad over a phone. I forgot all about the phone after that just kept laughing and the phone worked it is one of the funniest stories. "	32
21454	" Sometime life is complicated. Nothing is ever black and white. This is a short glance of my childhood. I think the best placed to start is the beginning.  When I was about @NUM1 years of age I had my first memory. My dad, @PERSON3, my brothers and I were all at a pond over in @LOCATION1. We were racing @CAPS1 boats that my dad had build. We would go there every other @DATE1 after school, from the moment I get out of school till it is so dark outside you can'@CAPS4 see you hand right in front of your face. One particular time I remember going, was the time my brother decided I need to go for a swim. My brothers and I got along but were never really close to one another. @CAPS9 loved pulling pranks on me, being that I was the youngest. So I was standing next to my dad and brother, there was a whole bunch of small ferns around us. My brother @PERSON2 jumped out of one of the bushes behind me and it made me jump. Meanwhile my brother @PERSON1 was on his hands and knees waiting for be to jump so he can make me trip over him. Well I did, there was a drop off at the edge of the pond that no one really noticed and I went tumbling down the hill. My elbow ran into stomach and my head hit a rock, then a @CAPS2! I was now soaked laying there a gooey green monster. At the moment no one was laughing but later on we did. The rest of that night no one really talked. The sun was just starting to set and I was sitting on the tail of a truck covered with blankets as my dad, brothers and @PERSON3 stood in the setting sun. I will never forget that loomenesint sight. As years pasted things gradually got worse between my brothers and myself. Things weren'@CAPS4 quit as easy. There wasn'@CAPS4 a forgive and forget. My brother @PERSON2 is five years older than me. He has @CAPS3 and serious relationship problems. One day he decided he was going to take out his problems on me. I was about @NUM2 years old. I loved my brothers and I didn'@CAPS4 know his ulterior motive at the time. My whole family except my dad was watching @CAPS4.V. in the living room. My brother @PERSON2 went back to his room and put spider man into his mini @CAPS5 player and climbed up the ladder into his bed. It was a titanium bed with a desk on the bottom, the top bunk was nearly kissing the sealing. He came out of his room and went into the kitchen and filled up his water bottle. As he filled his bottle up he asked if anyone wanted to watch spider man. Being my mother was watching the news I took him up on his offer. We both climbed up into the top bunk and watched the movie. We watched it for a little. I was cold so he offered me a blankets I got him last @CAPS6. It was fuzzy thick and warm with a huge tiger on it. Like most boys he slept in boxers and that was kinda weird seeing him walk around in them. But I never said anything. As we laid there he stuck his hand into my pants. I pushed him away and continued to watch the movie. He tried it several more times but I wouldn'@CAPS4 let him. I didn'@CAPS4 think it was right. But then he pinned my down with his leg across mine. I didn'@CAPS4 scream. He started to wiggle his finger around in my pants, it stung. I told him deliberately to stop, he didn'@CAPS4. Then he grabbed a pencil from behind him and stuck it in my vagina. Seconds later my dad walked in and said it was bed time. My brother threw himself back and I went soaring out of his room. That night was the first time my dad didn'@CAPS4 read me a bedtime story.  A few months later my brother @PERSON1 started acting weird too. He was always jittery around me and was never relaxed. One day he went out and bought a whole bunch of my favorite candy. Those @CAPS7 ""@CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's."" @CAPS9 look like a @ORGANIZATION1 that was white and crunchy on the outside and the inside is full of chocolate. He would bribe me with these, saying, ""I will give you one box of @CAPS8 @ORGANIZATION1's if you let me touch you in three places of my choice."" I didn'@CAPS4 know it was wrong. I just wanted the candy, so I let him. This interaction went on for about a year. He never did anything to invasive. After all this stuff happened I really didn'@CAPS4 know what to do with myself. Once I knew it was wrong I cried but that didn'@CAPS4 help. So I tried laughing and it worked. Knowing that laughter is a key part in forgetting things, helped me move on."	42
21460	" I am going to tell you a story about when I was a young boy and, how I used to go on long trip with my father because he was a long-haul truck driver. Me and mi dad went many places around the @LOCATION2 all of them being very fun and amazing. And we all had a lot of laughs The one that i liked the most though was when we went to @LOCATION1 that place was so amazing there are so many things to do, as well as so many things to visit. Things that you could just see like the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 that was pretty cool i thought and all of the monuments. My dad told me to go and see if i could get past security at the @ORGANIZATION1 and i was like nah i am good you can though and i laughed at him; @CAPS1 place that i liked a lot that we went to would have to be @LOCATION3, even though it was very hot and muggy it was still fun. I remember my dad telling us that we had a lot of extra time and that he was going to be taking us to the zoo man was that cool we got to see all of the awesome animals such as the lions, the crocodiles, monkeys, gorillas , and the penguins. It was one of the best trips that my father ever took me on i liked it a lot. One of the funniest memories that i do remember is when we were driving throught the desert and there was this paper in the air and i did not know what it was so i was like, ""dad what is that""? and he says ""that is a falling star"" i was like ""in the middle of the day""? and it took me till about a couple years to figure out what it really was but now i know what it was and i just look back to that day and laugh."	32
21468	"All the great memories that @LOCATION2 and I, spent and shared together when we were really good bestfriends. We were around @NUM1 years old and in @NUM2 through @NUM3 grade. Ofcourse we got older as the years went by, but we had soo many great times together. When ever we hung out, we would always laugh about almost everything, and most of the time we would just never let alot of stupid things get to us. Whenever I needed someone to talk to she would be the one. She went through a life that was almost the same as what I went through in life, and so she knows what I or even she needs to do or say. Even though we would always have lots of fun, we would have our moments and fight, but alwways work things out. We'd always have each others back for everything. I guess what im trying to say is that, two people who are close always have their great needs and feelings, and especially their laughter in the relationship. Here are some times that @LOCATION2 and I shared and spent together that pretty much led up to laughter.I remember in @NUM2 grade, both of us would always try to hang out whenever we could. We were still young so it was hard to do be able to do anything becuase our parents wouldnt let us most the time. Whenever we did though, we would think about random games, and go to different places just to have fun. As we got older though we were trusted more and could do lots more of things, which was a good thing. Then I moved to @LOCATION1, not the greatest thing, but it was for love. What made it better was that she still came over all the time. We would go and pick her up on @DATE1 and then on @DATE2 my mom would drive to school because my mom still went to work there in florence. Every night that she was there we would always stay up. I remember that I would always keep these little hot chocalate packages in my room and after my parents went to bed we'd sneak out to go get hot water for it so that we would have hot chocalate to drink. Some other times we would make coffee so that we could stay up longer. It was hard sometimes because my room was right across from my parents room and at the time I had beads hanging from my door. Fun times trying to keep quiet and not get caught. Sometimes when she came over she would bring all her make up and things so that we could dress each other up. One night we had blind folds on and do each others makeup."	35
21475	" Do you remember the first day of @NUM1 grade? Everyone is awkwardly and excitedly standing there waiting for their seating arrangement. You have the middle school jidders and everything is just happening to fast, I remember all that. I went to school at @CAPS1 for my middle school years, my teacher was @PERSON3. She was the type of teacher that was strict when it came to where you sat in class. If you didn't like someone, she would probably sit you by them thinking that you two would magically become friends. I was standing there in the corner with my best friend @CAPS2, we were of course hoping that we would be seated next to each other. After we finally got our seating arrangements, we were not seated together. I was sat next to @PERSON4-- a girl that I didn't know at all-- @PERSON5, @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. I was friends with everyone except @PERSON4, who I have never saw before in my life. As class went on @PERSON6 talked about middle school and how it is so important to get good grades and be prepared for high school, we all sat there and as to what it looked liked day dreamed. No one really talked to anyone, there was still that awkward first day thing going on. @PERSON4 looked like a girl that would rip your head off if you said anything to her, so I kept my mouth shut.  @PERSON6 went on with her ""first day lecture"" and all of a sudden she cracked a joke in the middle of her speech, to get our attention. We all started laughing. I would have to say that it was a very good ice breaker. After everyone after everyone laughed for a while, it seemed like everyone loosened up a bit. @PERSON4 and I started talking about how that joke was only funny because it was so dang stupid. From then on we kept talking and she seemed like a cool person. @PERSON4 and I became partners for every project that we did and we were always together, she became my best friend after @NUM2 days; all because of laughter. I would have to say that the reason @PERSON4 and I became friends is because of laughter. I probably never would have talked to her in the first place; even though I am glad I did because now I have an awesome best friend! Middle school can be scary, excpecially on the first day of school. That's why I think laughter is such an important part in someones relationship, you can't get by without it! "	40
21480	"  Laughter in life is a good thing to have I believe. Once @CAPS3 I was @NUM1 year's old I had a and @CAPS1. We always loved to hang out and do things together like take walks, or go to the beach, or go to the parks. What was so funny was that that we also loved to eat together too, maybe not out his dog bowl, but off of plates or on a picnic table. He was a cute dog. He had four little puppies named @CAPS5-@CAPS6, popcorn,big tail, and mountain. I named them all weird animal names because that's either what they smelled like or that's what they looked or loved doing.  Why we named my dog @CAPS1 was because he always smelt like @CAPS1. I always took him on walks to make him a healthy dog. It made me very angry @CAPS3 he had puppies and a mate. I don't know why maybe just because head I really loved my dog and i wanted him to be mine only. My favorite friend. I thought in my head hey! that's my dog and you leave him alone and do not touch him. Well @CAPS3 he had puppies i finally realized in my head @CAPS1 just wanted a life of his own too, a family, and be a big boy dog. He didn't hate me, he loved me and giving him a family is what I allowed and it made him happy. What was funny about the little puppies was that they smelt like odd food, like @CAPS1, @CAPS5 chops, or popcorn. My favorite puppy was @CAPS5 @CAPS6 because that's what he smelt like, not @CAPS1 but @CAPS5. POPCORN was a good dog too so was the other dogs but @CAPS5 @CAPS6 was a biter. It's funny because those little puppies love to bite and chew on stuff. The second you leave my puppies alone they will so eat everything. One time @CAPS3 we went on a trip to another state he had to leave the puppies alone with a babysitter, and @CAPS3 we came back they ate up a lot of the clothes and destroyed everything. I also had @CAPS11 too but they weren't good animals or pets to have they also ate everything up, and they stink. No not like @CAPS1 or popcorn but something else gross. The puppies loved to nibble on your toes and your hair. They had small teeth but oh they hurt. Stinky breath those dogs had I don't know why but there stinky. One of my favorite story about @CAPS1 was that he never liked to swim. It was odd to me because you would have thought cats hate water more than dogs. Well @CAPS1 did not know how to swim so I had to teach him myself as a good owner and all. Well @CAPS3 ever he doggy-paddled, he stuck his head underwater and swam forward. I don't know why, but I always thought can he breath like that? or is it just a doggy thing. Well eventually I got him over that, I don't think it was good for him to swim underwater. Like cats he used to never like water, it was just a phobia my dog had I guess. But I tried my best to get him over it. @CAPS3 I moved around states I had to leave him it was the saddest thing in my life ever. But we all move on right. Laughter I think is so good to have in your life because it can help you become more anti-depressed and not have to focus on the bad things in life. Every now and then @CAPS3 I am sad i just go and think of @CAPS1. I had other animals like @CAPS10, @CAPS11, @CAPS12, and cats. Personally I love cats more than dogs but @CAPS1 will always be the first. My cats weren't really that social to me, there lazy.What was so funny about my cats was that I named one of them @CAPS14. Why I named that cat @CAPS14 was because he was all black but with white feet. It was funny because @CAPS3 ever he got mad he did a lot of turning and jumping around. He was a wild kitty. I named one of my cats @CAPS15 because he was so fast at everything. What was funny about him was @CAPS3 ever you play around with him he charged off like he ate a bowl of cat nip. Having animals in my life to be with gave me a story of laughter in my life, and happiness. Laughter I think is a good important part of relationships too. If you do not laugh in your relationship then I believe that the couple are not so happy. Laughter can be good many time's, but also can be a insult too. If it means becoming a insult to some people or even laughing at people is rude.  Having laughter in your life is something you should always keep because it can help you become happy in many situations and problems you encounter in life. To be happy you should have laughter."	32
21485	"Freshmen year, @CAPS1 season. I have been @CAPS1 for about eight years now, I made varsity in a @NUM1 school in @LOCATION1 my first year in high school. Being the only freshmen on the varsity squad, everybody knew who I was, ""The short kid on the varsity @CAPS1 squad."" @CAPS2 a eighth grader I won junior state and wrestled all the way through the brackets without @CAPS1 a full match. Meaning that I pinned everyone in the first round. I couldn't be touched. Going into high school I knew that I wouldn't have @CAPS2 easy of a time like in grade school. I was completely right. My coach had to be the funniest person that I have ever met in my life. @PERSON1 was my @CAPS3 teacher since the @NUM2 grade and has been my role model all the way through life. He made the funniest jokes about wrestlers on the team. A lot of people disliked @PERSON1 @CAPS12 @CAPS4 and him got along great. I ended the season freshmen year with @NUM3 wins, @NUM4 pins, and @NUM4 losses. I still to @CAPS13 day haven't been pinned. Which got @CAPS4 the wrestler of the year awarded by my @CAPS1 coach @PERSON4. When the season rolled around to regionals I knew that I had a shot to go to state. There were six guys in my weight class and four of the six I have previously beaten in early season. I had to just worry about my match ahead of @CAPS4 and wrestle mistake free.  At the @NUM6 pound weight class there is a bunch of little kids. I was definitely the most experienced in my weight class. I got seated first seed. The second seed was @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1. He dropped weight so he could try and take my seating for state. My first match I wrestled @CAPS5 from @CAPS6-@CAPS7-@CAPS8. The match was very short-lived. I pinned him in about @NUM4 seconds. After my match with @CAPS5 I walked to my coach and he told @CAPS4 a quote that I will never forget, ""@CAPS10, @CAPS11's lonely at the top, @CAPS12 the view is excellent."" @CAPS13 quote stuck in my head throughout all of my next matches. I won my second and third matches and was in the semi-finals. I was one round away from going to state automatically. I wrestled @CAPS5 from @PERSON3 and he weighed @NUM8 lbs. I knew that he was a good wrestler even though I had about @NUM9 pounds on him. I was getting ready to wrestle and I seen @CAPS5 warming up across the gym from @CAPS4. @CAPS2 he was jumping around getting warmed up I see him trip and fall on his face. My coach had seen the same thing and started making fun of him. @CAPS11 was the funniest thing that I have ever witnessed. I wrestled through the match and pinned him in double overtime to go to state. My coach walks up to @CAPS4 and says ""@CAPS11 took you that long to pin someone who can't even warm up without falling on his face."" @PERSON1 had about three teeth total in his mouth. He lost them from a lot of different ways. He was a adventure man. He loved white water rafting and loved the sport of @CAPS1. When I moved, I was far away from my idolized @CAPS1 coach, @CAPS12 we still hit @CAPS11 up on the facebook and chitchat. To @CAPS13 day, he is still the funniest man I know and still my idol."	36
21491	" Life is a serious matter that should be taken into consideration. Life is what you make it and I have gave my best efforts to achieve this goal; even when it seems senseless. It maybe be hard to not be an effect of the worlds chaos and daily epidemic but doesn't seem easier or less stressful to smile than to frown. To live life in the moment with no worries of what is gonna happen just to be care free, I would consider it exhilarating. To be nothing but the purest form of tranquility.   My memories as a child are faint, but I am glad to say that I have some. Happiness as a child is most pure in my position . I long for that purity I once had, as most do. It was my favorite pair of plastic barbie high heal shoes or my special princess backpack with every princess or @CAPS1 @CAPS2. It was my parents making funny faces that made me explode in laughter because I could not possible hold it in any longer. All I longed for was a pick-nick under my favorite long green haired willow tree, to feel as free as the birds, to sing their beautiful songs, and to dance around with a never ending smile. It's the fragile youth of a child I longed for. It's a fragile youth of a child. As life goes on my purity has faded and the distance from people, the community, and myself has extended till I felt alone in sol om. I had changed as person when life when life burned me one to many times. I felt god had betray me if not hated me. I then had became a stone cold wall that no one could penetrate. But as I gazed into the mirror I no longer seen a @CAPS3 for life just hatred. This moment in time changed my life perspective. My strong hatred for the world was begin to handicap me in various if not most important aspect. If couldn't open up to myself - how could I open up to the world? To @CAPS3, to learn, to be free, and to grow was my ultimate goal. Within myself I learned the most important lesson; laughter and wiliness to be optimistic, compassionate, and understanding. Someone once said ,""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""I believe this is an honest opinion worth trying to prove. Laughter changed my life, my world, and it's a reoccurring symptom that take pride in everyday. In my most embarrassing moments, most angry of times, and even within my deepest sorrows I still manage to scrap up a smile. Helping people helped me realize and understand this is passion of mine. I want to help the world not hide from their pain but just to realize life can take a twisted turn and still end up being alright. Even within the deepest darkest caves, their is always a rock awaiting to crumb to bring light. To me their is always a light at the end of the tunnel. In my light -- a smile can carry. I want to be that light. I want to be that re-leaving feeling that everything will be all right. so I live me life through a gracious smile. In my perspective if you create a smile and you will receive three more. This is my motto,"" @CAPS3 life for what it's new adventures bring, just smile, the world will continuously turn as life rolls on."""	30
21502	"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 A @CAPS4 @CAPS5. I felt simply @CAPS5. I was very stoical; my life was nadir. Helplessly. I had written a @CAPS2 to my hero; no reply. I was determine to wait @CAPS3 see if my hero would ever reply.... My hero is amazing, lighting, astounding; his name is @PERSON6. I understand his music.  My best friend @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I, would always talk about how awesome his music is; in fact @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @ORGANIZATION1. We were two different people; I didn'@CAPS8 even think we could be friends, or have anything in common. @CAPS20' music brought us together.  @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I wrote a @CAPS2 to @LOCATION1; I thought to myself ""@PERSON6 is not even going to look at it,"" but I watched @PERSON4 write the @CAPS2. Weeks @CAPS3 weeks past by @CAPS3 I really thought @ORGANIZATION1 wasn'@CAPS8 going to read or reply. After that @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started to dilapidated. I felt discourage; we only talked about @PERSON6 @CAPS3 @CAPS6 photography project. We were really procrastinating toward @CAPS6 project; I had been a little distracted with cheer-leading @CAPS3 homework form the high school; not college homework. I was ignoring @PERSON4 calls @CAPS3 texts. Until I realize I had made a wrong choice; @CAPS15 I called my friend @PERSON4--thank god I did. A week later @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I @CAPS3 two of my friends: @PERSON5, my best friend since seventh grade; @LOCATION2, my best friend since eighth grade, had went to watch this really vehement movie. After the movie we went to meet up with some friends at the dorms. On @CAPS6 way there, @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I were telling @PERSON5 @CAPS3 @PERSON4 about @CAPS6 amazing experience in health: @CAPS6 health teacher had given us an assignment about what a perfect body should look like. @PERSON2 @CAPS3 I, facetious made an alien-looking body. The toes of this alien were coming out of its shoes @CAPS3 @CAPS6 alien had warts all over. We laughed non-stop, obviously we didn'@CAPS8 turn it in. When we arrived to the dorms, @CAPS3 @PERSON4 presented me to his friend @CAPS8.J; @CAPS18 was a big fan of @ORGANIZATION1. ""@CAPS9."" @CAPS10 we played various games I notice @CAPS8.J, had some warts on his hands, @CAPS3 when @CAPS18 took off his shoes; to put on his saddles, I couldn'@CAPS8 help but notice @CAPS18 somewhat reminded me of @CAPS6 drawing. I hysterically started to laugh non-stop, my friend @CAPS12 kept asking me why I was laughing, I said ""@CAPS8.J looks like my alien,"" @CAPS18 said ""wow that's rude."" I said ""In my eyes that's the perfect body."" We all had a good laugh @CAPS3 kept playing games @CAPS3 listening to @ORGANIZATION1. The next day @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I had to meet, to work on @CAPS6 photography project. All we had to accomplish was to take pictures of each-other @CAPS3 the things that we like @CAPS3 dislike. It was called: getting to really know a person. I learned a lot about @PERSON4 threw this project. In my opinion, I sometimes live life to fast, @CAPS3 I can barely catch my breath. I want to do everything but school @CAPS3 sports sometimes held me back; not in a bad way. I just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest. But I love my life @CAPS3 wouldn'@CAPS8 trade it; everything that I do gets me closer to my goal: @CAPS14.B.I agent. This project was vehement. To me it was a @CAPS1, a way of life telling me ""hang on, you'll make it;"" all due to a simple call. We were working hard, when @PERSON4 phone kept ringing. I was a little cantankerous. I said "" @PERSON4 answer the phone!"" @CAPS15 @CAPS18 did. @CAPS18 said "" oh my god, @CAPS16 is @PERSON6, I said ""stop messing around, now lets get back to work!"" @CAPS17 put his phone on speaker, @CAPS3 there it was; my hero on the phone! I was @CAPS15 happy that I started to cry, how could this be happening to us! I blacked-out, it was like I was stoical. How could this ever happen to ""quotidian teens."" I could hear @PERSON4 talking to @ORGANIZATION1 but I was making my my mind convoluted. I took a gasp of air, @CAPS3 said ""hello."" (I was still in shock.) @CAPS18 said "" hello @PERSON3, good luck in track."" @CAPS3 that's when I past-out. When I woke up @PERSON4 @CAPS3 I couldn'@CAPS8 believe it. We cried, then to ease the tension, @PERSON4 said ""@CAPS16, you talked to your husband."" We laughed for a long time. @CAPS17 @CAPS3 I have the best memory together. @CAPS6 @CAPS4 started because of @CAPS20 music, @CAPS3 it will never end. That day I realized: one: miracles happen; two: laugh heals the heart; @CAPS3 three: always have faith, never give up, someone will always hear you @CAPS3 give you advice when everything feels like is coming down on you @CAPS3 if it is as @PERSON1 said ""jump of a cliff, @CAPS3 built your wings on the way down,"" or someone will help you built them!  As @PERSON6 said ""come take my hand, we'll walk this road together.""   "	38
21508	" Laughter is necessary to survive in this crazy and beautiful world. It is something we possess with us throughout our lifetime. As humans, we grow old and eventually die, but laughter never does. It lives on forever. Laughter is often referred to as 'the best medicine', and why shouldn't it be? It brings joy to the sad, relief to the burdened, and life to the depressed. The best part about laughing is that it is completely and unchangeably free! Never will someone have to pay to gain a drop of laughter. On the other hand, laughter is also contagious. A single smile, throw back of a head, and a gut busting laugh can cause an entire room to become ill to this glorified epidemic. Laughter is the best release. When I was younger I had a neighbor named @ORGANIZATION2. @PERSON1 was an older man who spent most of his time in his carpentering shop. He never talked to the rest of us on our street nor did we attempt to strike up a conversation with him. Day in and day out I would notice his little red pick-up leave in the morning and return at night. His life seemed like more of a routine and I was curious to find out why. @PERSON1 had a wife who, as well, became a vampire to the rest of us. This was completely fine, because to us, she was a monster. Countless times soccer balls would be kicked into her yard by pure accident and she would come out of her quiet house yelling and waving her hands in our direction. She even left a note on my family's front door telling them to ""take better care of your lawn"". I sympathized with @PERSON1 for having to live with the woman. Something in her voice seemed off, as if she was deaf. That aspect of her life always made me feel a little bad for her. Being different could have been a possible explanation to why she treated people the way that she did.  I will never forget the day the ambulance pulled up in front of their perfectly serene house. I sat on my front porch silently watching the medics go inside the house. Not long after, I heard the little red pick-up coming up the road. I knew, as far as everyone else on @ORGANIZATION1, that this was not part of the routine. After about @NUM1 minutes, a body was carried out on a stretcher. My heart sank. Even though I was young, I knew the significance of a hovering white sheet over a being. @PERSON1 was very secluded after his wife passed away. Nobody could blame him for that. He lost the love of his life; he lost his routine. My family discussed and decided to bring him meals. The food was never anything particularly fancy, just something that would keep him going. I've never seen anyone so appreciative. Still, we knew to stay off of his lawn. His wife loved it and he must have felt like she was still attached to it somehow. He was lonely and my family wanted to be there for him. Soon after we brought over meals, my younger sister and I started walking his small, white, fluffy dog and invited him over for dinner as often as our mom would let us. He became more like a grandfather than a neighbor. One day, my friends and I were outside playing soccer on our small street. It was sunny and warm outside. Life was good. I could feel the vivacity of youth pulsing through my veins as I ran around. As of on its own, the ball rolled into @ORGANIZATION2's yard. We all hesitated when we saw his door open. He looked pestered and quite upset as he slowly bent down to pick up our ball. I winced, knowing I'd hear about this later from my parents. Then the unexpected happened, @PERSON1 started laughing. The kind of laugh where a person might be considered crazy for being that happy. The kind of laugh where tears run down a person's face. Not knowing what to do, my friends and I started giggling to ourselves. @PERSON1 threw us the ball and went back inside. His laugh was a clear signal, @ORGANIZATION2's grieving and unhappy soul had been relieved.  From then on, laughter has meant a great deal to me. Laughing can direct you straight to a person's soul. It can be the connection between people. Without laughter, life can seem dull. Once it is brought into your life, it has the powers to heal and restart. That is exactly what it did for @ORGANIZATION2. Through laughter, he got his life back."	45
21513	"                       Laughter   @CAPS1 is like a drug that works better than any other painkiller, or anti-depressant out there. It makes angry people happy, and happy people ecstatic. One of the best ways and more common ways to have a good laugh is by watching a funny movie. Any time I'm asked @CAPS10's your favorite comedy I say ""@CAPS2 with @PERSON1"". I remember the first time I watched a @PERSON1 movie. I was about @NUM1 years young; I was in second grade, it was towards the end of the school year, and I couldn't wait to get out for the @DATE1 and just have fun. It was any ordinary boring day @CAPS7 school and I remember walking home hoping there would be something fun to do when I got home. I walked in the door to see my brother watching @CAPS3, I asked him @CAPS10 he was watching but he just ignored me so I went to my room to do homework. I finished my homework and walked into the living room and plopped down on the couch next to my brother, I asked @CAPS10 he was watching a second time, he let out an annoyed sigh and said some movie called ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" was about to start. Within the first five minutes we were already @CAPS1, not just giggling or slightly chuckling, tears were rolling down our faces from all the @CAPS1. I remember saying to my brother ""@CAPS6 is the funniest movie I've ever seen!"" @CAPS7 the end of the movie my brother and I couldn't stop quoting the movie, every @NUM2 seconds we'd quote it, it was non stop laughter. We sat there on the couch patiently waiting to see @CAPS10 was on next wishing and hoping it was another movie as incredible as the one we just watched, and sure enough after the commercial break we learned that it was a @PERSON1 marathon, and on next was ""@CAPS8 @CAPS9"". The movie started out just as funny as the last one, with @PERSON1 doing something completely idiotic, yet absolutely hilarious, like growling @CAPS7 some dogs over a loudspeaker. We couldn't get enough of @CAPS6 guy, my brother was rolling on the floor @CAPS1 and crying, and I was still watching waiting to see @CAPS10 happened next. About half way through the movie my mom got home from work, she walked in to see my brother and I in hysterics, she said ""@CAPS10's so funny?"" We just pointed @CAPS7 the @CAPS3 right as @PERSON1 started rolling down a hill. Soon enough our mom was watching it too, @CAPS1 just as hard as we were. I was having a great time, a genuinely great time with my family, @CAPS10 more could I ask for? How about another @PERSON1 movie? On next was a movie called ""@CAPS12 @CAPS13 @CAPS14"", completely ridiculous, and completely hilarious, @CAPS10's funnier than an overweight guy trying to be a @CAPS14? We continued to watch the movie until dinner time, we inhaled our food as fast as we could and then raced back to the couch to continue watching. When it was time for bed I remember staying up late reciting quotes from the movie in our bunk beds until our mom came in and told us to be quiet. I don't know how we slept @CAPS7 all after @CAPS1 all night. The movies left us speechless, we had never seen @CAPS2 funnier, they made us laugh, they made us cry, they made our stomachs ache, and through it all it brought my brother and I closer. To @CAPS6 day my brother and I can sit down and watch one of those movies and laugh and remember all the times we have watched them before and all the laughs we shared, I swear half of my childhood consisted of @CAPS1, and @PERCENT1 of that @CAPS1 came from those movies. The movies helped me to develop a funny personality, they shaped @CAPS10 I think is humorous, and they make me realize that after sharing something so funny with someone I love, that laughter is an important aspect in our lives, without it life would be plain and dull like a meaningless blob of clay. Have you ever gone a day without @CAPS1? If so you know how long and dull it can get without having something that brings a smile to your face there. Laughter brings people together, it brings out the best in us, when you're mad or upset the best way to cure your anger or frustration is by having a good laugh.     "	37
21518	" Laughter is almost always a good thing, mainly because when people laugh it means their happy or something is funny. It can be very beneficial at times, for instance when someone is not feeling to happy people always try to make them laugh to make them feel better. When I am faced with someone I don't know usually my first instinct is to try to and them laugh. laughter has always been a source of enjoyment and it still is today, We have certain advantages now than we had one hundred years ago. For instance now @CAPS2 we want to laugh we need only to pick up remote and turn on the @CAPS1, we can even choose what we want to laugh at and we even have the ability to go and search for something to laugh at on the internet. Sometimes people go to comedy clubs to go and see a stand up comedians. Comedy and laughter go hand in hand, from the very first time someone laughed comedy was born and will be around forever unless being happy becomes outlawed. I remember that when ever my parents would have a new friend over then only thing I would hear when they were at my house was then sound of both my parents and our new guest laughing. Soon the new guest was over much more often.  Laughing is also a very important part of any relationship because it makes the person whom is making the other laugh more of a pleasure to be around and thus makes them sometimes like them more, @CAPS2 you have ever noticed men usually try to make the women laugh in order to try to get that member of the opposite sex to like them. This and the accompanying of physical attraction help start the relationship. I have herd but am not certain that laughter can also be therapeutic, sometimes I like to laugh when I'm not felling so good so it @MONTH1 possibly be therapeutic for me. @CAPS2 this is so than people have been going through therapy for many years. Sometimes people laugh even @CAPS2 the subject is not funny they only do this because otherwise the situation would be somewhat awkward and one might fell kind of out of place. Everyone has a different laugh some are louder than others and some have a type of rhythm to them, my mother has a very loud and high pitched laugh and my grandpa has a low and scratchy laugh, no matter what your laugh is like it can help you feel better it can also help you become closer to someone. laughing is just one of life's greatest pleasures and we should all take a chance to just sit and laugh."	40
21526	" I have a friend and her name is @PERSON1. I have known her since we were both in the fifth grade and in the same class. We have been friends for about five to six years now and it has been a great friendship. About two years ago for her fifteenth bithday party she invited a couple of her friends and I to spend the day over at her dads house in @LOCATION1. The plan was to hang out, have fun ,and pretty much do whatever we wanted to do because it was her birthday. There was a pool to swim in, and flatscreen television to watch movies, plenty of board games top go around, and quite a few people to have a conversation with. On the morning of @DATE1 we all loaded up the car around noon and made our way to her dads appartment in @LOCATION1. A short @NUM1 minutes later we had arrived at the appartment complex. We were all so excited to get the entire day to hang out, and have an amazing sleepover for @ORGANIZATION1's birthday. The second that the van had stopped all five of the people that were in the car including me unbuckled our seat belts as fast as we could and got up out of the seats to head to the house. Everybody had gotten there seatbelt unbuckled except for @CAPS4 friend @PERSON2. She had thought she heard, and felt the seatbelt button click to release it, but it never disengaged. While the seat belt was still on she attempted to jump up out of her seat but at the last second the seatbelt caught her by the waste and jerked her back down to her spot. She had layed there with her arms to her sides with her head all the way back against the head rest and moaned for a good ten seconds. This was one of the many events of laughter that had happened that day.  A good two hours had gone by and the five of us were chillin' out in the living room and talking about what to do next. @PERSON1 had suggested ""@CAPS1 guys, we should all go to the pool for a couple of hours, swim, and tan."" The rest of us were all for it concidering the fact that it was probably one hundred degrees outside, the weather was super sunny, and clear, and because it was @CAPS2 @PERSON1 birthday, and she should be able to do whatever she wants. Then after the conversation we all got our swim suites on, grabbed our towls, and whatever else we needed for the pool, and headed out the door. Little did we know but the blacktop outside was boiling! Of course we were all barefoot because we were just going to go jump in the pool anyways. We all then took one step out on the blacktop, and all you could here was screaming, and yelling. ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5! @CAPS4 feet are on fire!"" @PERSON2 remarked. We had all agreed with her at that very moment of time. Since the blacktop was outrageously hot @PERSON2 started running for the grass that was about two hundred feet away. I would say thirty seconds later @PERSON2 had finally reached the grass and all we heard was. ""@CAPS6!"" all of us looked up at @LOCATION2. She was laying flat on her back because the sprinklers had been on recently and she didnt know so her feet flew right out in front of her and landed on her back. We all started laughing but running at the same time. I helped @PERSON2 get up off of the ground and then we all continued our journey to the pool. I think you can guess that something else funny happened with @PERSON2."	40
21533	" My dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit. I was nervous in the beginning ofcourse, but quickly became comfortable behind the wheel. I drove all over town completeing some errands we had to do along the way. Now it was time to go through the car wash, my first time in a carwash with me in control. I didnt think a car wash would be difficult to achieve after driving all around town, but i was wrong. After having a hard time pulling up to the right spot so the wash could start i had to roll up all the windows and fold the side view mirrors. Before i could do all that the wash had started! As a hurricane of soap swirled around the car i rushed to fold the side view mirror and was succesful. Unfortunately due to my slow reaction times i could not also roll up my driver window as the soap came back around and enveloped me in white foam. My dad and i were all wet and the inside of the car got all cleaned even though that wasnt the plan at first. I finally rolled up my window looked at my dad. He looked back at me not saying anything, the car was silent. After our minds finally developed wat happened we broke out in laughter. We had not stoppped laughing through the whole car wash and after because of the rarity of that situation. All i could say after that was that people go there whole lives without having that type of car wash incident, so why did it have to happen to me!"	35
21540	" Laughter in my life is one of the most important things, because it is often the motivation I need. Whether it be an embarrassing situation that I laugh at looking back on, or when I'm feeling angry and my best friend does something to make me crack up. Sometimes I just feel sad, and if I'm around the right people, the ones who bring the laughter out in me, I know it won't last long. I know that to get my mind off of something, all I need are a few giggle here and there.  Recently, I started going to the gym. I have always been overweight and out of shape, so the gym, like many other attempts, seemed like it wouldn't last long. When taking the tour of my gym originally with my mom, who suggested we try it out, I was pretty excited. Of course this was because it was something new, and I was pumped up enough that I wanted to start that day. My mom, being the more logical one, and of course, the one who would be paying monthly for the membership, wanted to think and talk it over a bit more. In the end, my mom decided that it was right for us. At first my mom kept me motivated. Because I was so out of shape, I got tired after five minutes on the elliptical, at the easiest setting. Seeing my mom beside me on the treadmill, working at it and not even slowing, kept me motivated. Just looking at her made me so happy that every now and then I'd just let out a short burst of laughter, followed by a questioning look from her, but then she would also laugh. Sometimes I thought it was just because I was tired and somewhat delirious from the exertion, but looking back on it now I know I was just happy that my mom and I finally had something to do together. The happy gym days were short-lived, because as usual, my mom was too tired and whatnot to go anymore. I promised myself to go once I was able to drive myself regularly. A few weeks after my birthday, I got my license, but another thing got in the way; my car was a @NUM1-speed, and I only knew @CAPS1 to drive automatic. So after begging my mom almost every day to take me to practice on my new car, she finally took me. In the dark church parking lot, the same one I started driving automatic in, more laughter between us started. She would have me close my eyes and ""feel"" where the clutch and accelerator @CAPS2 about halfway. At first I thought this was so absurd that I would just start cracking up, and my mom would join in with her laugh. Once I finally got the hang of taking off, which to me is the hardest part, but, like always, laughter was there to make things easier. I learned to drive stick quickly, and because I had made that promise to myself, my first trip for myself was to the gym. My motivation that time was being able to finally do something progressive just for me, and the satisfaction was doing it by myself. The whole way to the gym, I sang @PERSON1 in the twangiest voice I could muster, which led to more laughter. The first few times of going to the gym were based solely on the knowledge that I was doing something good for myself. After about the fourth time, though, my motivation started to dwindle. Instead of listening to my iPod while on the elliptical, I started to watch ""@CAPS1 I @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4,"" because it would get laughs out of me while I was still working my butt off. Before I knew it, the episode was over and I had been going strong for almost an hour, burning @NUM2 calories. I was so impressed with what I had accomplished that it felt like the motivation was fully replenished. I started going daily again. In a week and a half, I had lost @NUM3 pounds just by going to the gym, working out, and most of all, laughing. Part of it was self-motivation, but another part was the laughter that so easily distracted me from the task at hand. Because I had been getting into shape, I was also able to increase the ""@CAPS5"" level on the machine, and am still going every day. Each day it feels easier and easier, and now I have ""@CAPS6"" and ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"" to make me laugh even more while working out. I believe that in many cases, laughter has saved me. Whether I be sad, mad, down, or in this case, not motivated enough, it was always an option. Knowing I have those laughs to look forward to at the end of the day makes me keep getting in my car to drive to the gym. I'm still losing weight, and this is the first time in my life I've felt truly energized. Laughter was a huge part."	45
21546	" When I was about thirteen me and my older brother dissuaded we where going to spend the day fishing. I got out of bed that morning, throw on a pair of old torn up blue jeans and when downstairs to get some breakfast. On my way I could smell the sweet aroma of eggs and hash browns that made my mouth water. My brother was up and about and had just finished his plate. My mom handed me my plate and and I reached for the bottle of @CAPS1.Ethan was sitting across from me as i ate and said""We'll leave in an hour or so"".I said okay and went on eating.After breakfast we gathered our poles and tackle boxes and put them in the car along with an old boat we kind of jacked of the old neighbor lady. We put our stuff in the van and mom drove us into town. It was about eight in the morning so we wouldn't get back home till about three or four in the afternoon depending on how the fishing is. There was a little store in town and the creek went right behind it. It was a small creek. I grew up on it so I thought i knew what to expect. We put in behind the store and our mom left after telling us to be safe. It was a chilly @DATE1 morning and a little cloudy. The water was cold and my brother said I should wear his waiters. I thought it was silly seeing as we would be in a boat. Burt I put them on and we put the boat in the water. This was the first time we ever even used the boat so it was exciting.   As we went down stream the water got fast and loud and the embankment was like a wall to the outside world. As we took the next corner there it was. A water fall about as tall as a man. Not the kind you would see in the movies but it was good enough for our eyes. Right in the middle of it was a big rock and water went around both sides of it. We where pushed right up agenced the rock and where all most thrown from the boat and we grabbed the rock for dear life.We where stuck and I looked at my brother and he kneaded as if to say down is the only way.So with that being said we both let go and let the water have us. As soon as we let go it was like being om the back of a two thousand pound animal in a rodeo the only lasts a second. When the boat sunk my waiters filled up instantly and and it took all i had just to hold on to that boat that was pulling us down stream now. We lost all of our gear except the tackle boxes, an oar and that stupid boat. It took all we had but we finally got the boat out of the water and poured the water out of it and the water out of me. I was scared for my life now. This was suppose to be a fun fishing trip but it was now a game of survival. We couldn't turn back now. the only way to got home was to go the rest of the way. I was cold and wet and didn't have any options. We had to continue so we tried it again just to sink. We spent most of that day carrieing the boat around rapids and throw brush all day until it mellowed down and we could put the boat back in. We got to a big pool, so big you could fit a house in it. There where some small rapids running right throw the middle of it. It dint look bad but with what we had bean in we dissuaded to be extra car full. We went around the rapids through the pool. As we went we burly braised the end of the rapids with the boat and we went in. I tried to keep from sinking but my waiters where to heavy. As i tried to swim to shore my shoe fell off and went down stream. Being stupid a chased after it on my belly to get it. The water was faster then I thought as I let it @CAPS2 me. I was swallowing so much water and i couldn't breath. I could feel it begin to get deeper and soon I couldn't touch bottom at all. My shoe was right in front of me and I finally got to it with burly anything left. I got to shore and just law there choking up water. After ten minuets I got up and went back. I think it was freak luck we survived that day but some how we did. I learn a lot that day and laugh about it now."	35
21552	" Laughter is the best medicine for a friend in pain. My friend @CAPS1 and I were best friends, he came to my house every weekend. So while I waited for him I decided to ride my bike. I road around the block a couple of times, when I hit a curb and crashed. My handle bar hit me in the lower rib cage. My mom took my to the doctors office to see if I broke a rib. The doctor said I had only bruised it.  On the way home I was in so much pain, my mom made a stop for some ice cream, that didn't help. When we got home I just lade on the couch for a while. I heard knocking, it was @CAPS1. The first thing he did was asked what happened, I said I didn't wont to talk about it rite now. We ate diner then played a game. Then we watched some movies eventually we both fell asleep.  We woke to the smell of bacon. I was still a little asleep, by the time I realized that I had woke up @CAPS1 was down stars. I was in so much pain I couldn't get up. So I just lade there for a short while. @CAPS1 came back up the stares to see why I didn't get up. He seen me just laying there. We just started to laugh, I noticed that i felt a little better but I didn't think much of it. After we ate we turned on the @NUM1, my mom said for every one to clean but @CAPS1 and I could play, cause I was hurt and @CAPS1 was a guest. We play mortal combat @NUM2, @CAPS6 and @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 and @ORGANIZATION1. I won most of the time, tell he started to cheat, but it was still pretty fun.  When we were done we watched a funny movie, we laugh so much, that when it was I almost for got about my rib cage. We went to the park to shoot some hoops. As soon as he shot it then it bounced off the rim and hit him in the face, I thought that was funny, he didn't seem to think so. When we got bored we headed down to the market to get a snack. When we were eating I told him what happened with my bike, he ask if it made a visible mark, we look and seen it look just liked a smile face, it was funny but creepy. When we got home, he said that he wanted to ride bikes. At first I was a little scared, but nothing big. We rode around my yard for while. His mom got their shortly after. Then I went inside and just sat there. My mom asked how i felt, but it didn't hurt any more. I got better because laughter is the best medicine."	33
21557	" Have you ever laughed so hard that you cry? Your chest is bubbling with the laughter, and tears spilling out of your eyes; faces turn bright red and your body is practically having convulsions. This is not the forced kind of laughter, this is uncontrollable. This is pure joy. I laugh like this at least twice a day, tears and all. If it is even possible for your laugh reflexes to be connected to tear ducts, I swear I would have it. If I have a good laugh during the day, then I wont be so sad later to come. It has made me a much happier person. And it has even been able to bring me together with other people.  @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 was not a time when laughter was abundant in my life. This was a time in my life where I worried and would dwell on the past. I was a deep fourth grader. But my friends were much different. @CAPS4 did have their bad moods on occasion, and whenever we were feeling down we would sit on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Very creative, I know. This @CAPS2 was navy blue, and sat right at the corner of the playground right where the baseball field started. We would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives.  One day as we were dismissed to recess, four of my close friends and I went over to the @CAPS2. We watched as the boys ran as fast as @CAPS4 could to the field to get their daily game of football started. Almost every guy in the @ORGANIZATION1 would go to the baseball field and play touch football. It was the cool thing for the @ORGANIZATION1 studs. And sometimes the girls joined in too. While we were sitting there sulking on the @CAPS2, a few boys walked up to us.  ""@CAPS3 to play some football with us? We could use more people!"" @CAPS4 said. We weren't in the mood for playing football, but with the persistent nagging, we had to give in. The square field was soggy from the @ORGANIZATION2 rain, and the grass turned into muddy mush wherever you stepped. Us girls would avoid any contact and we ran much slower then the boys. But we managed to score a few points for our team, and duck for cover when needed. The football lightened our moods, and was much better at making us happy then the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. So a new tradition was formed. Every day we would go out with the boys and not have a care in the world as we chased each other around. We dove into the mushy mess of a field to save a ball, and lunged to tag any person we could get to. The @CAPS2 was out of all of our minds as we ran around having fun.  But one day while we were playing it was extra muddy from a storm the night before. It was hard to navigate as you were running around on the slick field. People were slipping and falling constantly. And then something amazing happened, it started raining all over again. But nobody had even thought of quitting. We just laughed and kept going. The rain blinded us, and the slick ground was no help. So a collision was inevitable. One of the girls picked up the football. The ball had been through a lot, and now it was covered in mud. She had a clear shot of the end zone, and sprinted the best she could given the circumstance. When out of nowhere a boy from the other team popped up in front of her. But instead of swerving to miss hitting him, she slid. It was a priceless moment, almost taken from a cartoon. Her legs slid out from under her and she landed square on her butt. Everyone on the field was already peeling over, clutching their stomachs from the laughter. But she continued to slide. The boy in front of her was too busy laughing to notice she was headed in his direction. That is when she took him out too. But he was unfortunate enough to land on his face. His body sprawled on top of hers with his head directly in the brown wet ground. Even the two that fell couldn't help but laughing. The game was halted as we all shared this priceless moment. We were brought together by a simple game of football, and uncontrollable laughter."	42
21563	" The sound of laughter could be one that breaks all barriers. Just a single giggle or quiet chuckle can expand someone's world. Laughter is a sign. It's something that tells someone new ideas, desires, or dreams are going to be created. Once one laughs, he or she getting along with someone -- they're forming a relationship. The first time @PERSON1 and I laughed together, there was no doubt in my mind it was the start of something new. Once I heard his cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, I was set and ready to be swept off my feet.  I was privileged to hear that laugh for three days of my summer in the year @DATE2. It was a @DATE1, and for the past four days I was bounding and skipping throughout mountains and hills in the never ending desert of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. That day, my cousin @CAPS1 and I were about to wander in to a familiar territory of ours: the mall. As a bonus, that cautious, unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle was bounding and skipping along with us. When @PERSON1 walked over to us in the food court, he definitely succeeded in playing it cool. You could tell he actually made time to comb his hair and decide what he was going to wear just to look as spiffy as he was. ""@CAPS2, hey guys!"" he called out smoothly. Our eyes met immediately, and already my cheeks hurt. The next few minutes that we spent together were crucial. I needed to make a good impression on this guy. We stood in the line of @ORGANIZATION1, where he would retrieve his usual order of two @CAPS3 @CAPS4' @CAPS5 without lettuce, a large order of fries, and a large @CAPS6. Pepper. As for me, all I wanted was a small vanilla ice cream cone. Glancing over at the other register, I saw @PERSON1 turn his head my way in the corner of my eye. ""@CAPS7, do you have @MONEY1?"" he hesitantly asked me. He fiddled with his pockets a little, while also brushing his luscious blond locks from his face. I chuckled silently to myself, and his reaction was one that is to this day one of my favorite things about him -- his smile. Still chuckling, I said ""@CAPS8,"" and carefully handed him the @MONEY1. To this day, @PERSON1 is my very best friend. Eventually, I did get back the @MONEY1 he owed me. Ever since that one moment when we were standing in the waiting line at @ORGANIZATION1, the next several hours were jam-packed with laughter. I don't really remember a single thing he said that didn't at the very least make me grin as hard as I could. Literally, with several leaps and flips, on that day I made a new friend. And even then, I was completely unaware of the amazing journey there was to come with this boy. It was all because of that very first natural instinct @PERSON1 and I both had towards each other; to laugh. If I had never laughed so hard my stomach was aching, or never laughed so hard tears were running down my cheeks, there is just no way we would have had the connection that we did. His unsure, delighted, and just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle never gets old. Laughter is one of the main keys in our friendship. One of us has to let out a little cackle every once in a while. Also, @PERSON1 is still in @LOCATION2. I'm not. As badly as we both wish we could be, we're not in the same place. We need to be able to thrive and grow in separate places. So, with that, if someone once said, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people."" then they were absolutely correct. When @PERSON1 and I laugh together, it doesn't feel like we're fifteen hundred miles apart. So this laughter, this just @CAPS2-so-very-cute giggle, is an element and part of my life that I am indescribably grateful for. This laughter formed one of the greatest relationships in my short fifteen years of life, and I sincerely hope it will form many more wonderful memories in the years to come."	46
21569	" It all started when my eighth grade class had a plan to go see a movie together. I had the idea to see a movie, so i picked a few movies that were in theaters. The choices were between, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2,' @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4,' and another movie that i cant remember. We, as a group, decided to go to @CAPS3 of the @CAPS4. The movie stars @PERSON1, and @CAPS7 from @CAPS8 @CAPS9. I thought that the movie was really good but there was one part in the movie that made me laugh so so hard. The scene starts out with @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 wandering around trying to find a place to stay for the night; and they seemed to have @CAPS4 @LOCATION1; @LOCATION1 plays an important part on the movie. After a long day full of scary situations, they find a good size cave that they decide is a good spot to stay for the night.   Back tracking a little bit, earlier that day, and in the movie, @PERSON1 came across a native fellow named @LOCATION1. @LOCATION1 is a a man like creature that walked like a monkey but has the face of a human but has an all around harry body. They came across him while traveling through the desert and saved him from execution; for that, @LOCATION1 is very grateful and is @CAPS11 guide around the mysterious @CAPS3 that is foreign to man and that has never been seen by man.  Back to what i was talking abot earlier, when @PERSON1 and @CAPS7 end up in the cave the see two full body skeletons sitting at a table that has an old record player on it, but the record is playing and making music. Just a second later @LOCATION1 comes in the frame of the scene and does a little dance that puts him close to, but in front of the table. Then @LOCATION1 does multiple pelvis thrusts to different directions, basically humping the air.  Watching that scene made me laugh the hardest that i have ever laughed in my life. To this day i look back at it and laugh just as hard as i did the first time i saw the movie.  About a month later, I went over to one of my good friends houses and we watched the movie again. When we got to the scene of @CAPS13 jig, we both fell down, off of the couch laughing. We replayed that scene about ten more times and ended up crying because we were laughing so hard.  Laughter is good for the soul and moral, and for friendship building. Thank the @CAPS14 that he made us laugh!"	34
21575	" To me laughter Is someone showing joy and excitement to the others around them. Laughter @MONTH1 some times be used In the wrong kind of way such as @CAPS1 someone where to get hurt In any kind of way the other person laughs at them when @CAPS2 hurt them. When I can make someone else laugh or giggle @CAPS2 not only makes me fill good but also the other person I was talking to. @CAPS2 shows both of us that we can be happy and that there Is joy @CAPS4 of us. I have a friend that I go to school with everyday and he always just looks so grumpy and or upset. And when someone asks him what Is wrong or @CAPS1 he Is okay @CAPS2 seems that he just gets more angry. So me being one of his closer friends I try and help him with that, and so far @CAPS2 has been working and I can make him happy by laughing and getting a big smile on his face. Every time I see him In the hall way or even out of school I will always say something to him to get him to smile and laugh. And by the way I show him I care and him knowing that I don't want him to be grumpy to others we have grew a bond and we seem to spend a lot more time together. And by him being In a better mood @CAPS2 makes his hole day of school lot funner and more enjoyable, and for all the others that are around him. @CAPS1 I were to explain who I was I would say that I am a very happy person and that I have respect for others and I express and show others that. Being happy brings joy to other people that are surrounding you witch usually leads to laughter. Laughter Is a very Important part of your daily life and I think that @CAPS2 brings people closer, so use @CAPS2 don't be afraid."	30
21582	" I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities. I have lots of stories of when I have maid people laugh. One time i was on my way to camp with some of my friends and I looked out the window and saw a sign. ""@CAPS1 butts, unless, that ""@CAPS2"" is an ""@CAPS3"" @CAPS7 @CAPS8 must be @CAPS1 @CAPS4."" I said. @CAPS8 was so funny i maid everyone in the car laugh. @CAPS7 later on, on the drive to camp with my friends we stopped at @CAPS5 in some city. When we stopped there I got inside a shopping basket and my friends and I were racing down the isles and maid all the other costumers laugh. When we where going to leave I bought a whole bunch of food. When we were back inside the car I crabbed the box of doughnuts I had bought and let everyone else in the car have one. We all started eating them and we had established that the doughnuts where really gross. The doughnuts tasted so dry, @CAPS8 was like they didn't even have any frosting on them. I opened my chocolate milk and I had to drink my chocolate milk with my doughnut just to make @CAPS8 taste a little bit more sweet. None of us had anymore doughnuts. @CAPS8 was so funny, we threw the doughnuts out the window. On the way back from the camp that we had gone to, my friend @PERSON1 was driving home and I sat behind him and I messed with him so much. I had turned my phone up onto its highest volume and played a scary ring-tone and I scared him and maid him jump. @CAPS7 I had licked my finger and put @CAPS8 inside his ear @CAPS7 he freaked out, because he thought @CAPS8 was really gross. After that he had his window open and I opened my window and stuck my hand around and grabbed his arm and scared him. @CAPS7 we had stopped by the store in some small town and god some soda and I bought a soda to drink. When we got back in the car and left I Said: ""@CAPS6't get pulled over, I just opened a beer. Haha."" @CAPS7 I took a drink of my soda and as I took the drink I started laughing again and some of my soda went up into my nose @CAPS7 I said: ""@CAPS8 burns so bad. My nose is burning."" All of us where laughing. The ironic part was that like thirty minutes after i had said that we got pulled over. We where driving down the highway and my friend @PERSON1 who was driving thought that the speed limit was sixty-five miles-per-hour but the speed limit was fifty-five. The cop pulled him over and clocked him doing seventy-five. I was gonna try and make the cop laugh, to see if we could lighten him up a little, but my friend @PERSON1 said no because he was so mad. He ended up getting a ticket and the cop was a real idiot. He looked at the license plate and @CAPS7 turned and asked @PERSON1 if they where @LOCATION1 plates, when clearly they said right on them @LOCATION1. Everyone in the car laughed so hard @CAPS8 was hilarious. The cop was really dumb. I @CAPS6't think that anyone who went with me to camp that weekend stopped laughing. I am so good at making people laugh, @CAPS8 is just one of my very awesome qualities."	34
21592	" We all understand the benefits of laughter. Laughter is definitely the most important part of my best friends and I relationship. Without laughter, we couldn't possibly have as much fun together as we do. If I am having a bad day, I can always count on my best friend to make me crack up, and forget about the day I have had. If we are out and about, or just relaxing at home, my best friend and I are always laughing. The end result is usually us both with tear streaked faces from laughing so hard. There are actually quite a few different instances in which I remember laughing particularity hard. This last @CAPS1 @CAPS2's eve for example, it started snowing at around three a.m, so my best friend and I ran outside screaming at the top of our lungs. Snowballs started coming from every direction. During a game of hide and go seek, we decided to bury ourselves in a snow covered leaf pile. Within ten minutes, our legs were freezing. So what did we do? We put on our swim suits and jumped into the bath tub together. Having her there to laugh with me, made the situation a lot better.  Another situation in which I remember being particularly funny, was the entire third trimester of freshman @CAPS2. I needed a first period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing. I definitely was not looking forward to it, until I found out that my best friend had it with me. We made a bad situation a lot better by laughing at every single stupid mistake we made. Since we are not exactly experienced in the field of metal, there were quite a few mistakes. With out my best friend there to laugh with me, I have no idea what I would have done. I believe that whenever I am in a bad situation, laughter will always help me. One last situation in which laughter helped a lot, is when I used it to cheer up my best friend. A couple of days ago, my friend had, had a really bad day. Things just weren't going her way. After school I could tell something was wrong. I tried talking to her about it, but that wasn't really helping. So, I brought up some of our past experiences together. Within a few minutes she was laughing and I could tell she felt a lot better. Laughter really does help us out of some tough situations. Laughter is by far the most important factor in my best friends and I relationship. Our relationship is mainly based on laughter. Without it, we just wouldn't be as close as we are today. If we need it to cheer each other up, or cure boredom, I know that laughter will always be on our side. "	40
21599	" I sat at the table, speechless, as they told me their story. The @CAPS1 had been through a lot in the past seven years. @PERSON1's youngest son was born three weeks early and the doctor told her he would only live for three days at the most. As she told me, she stared off into the distance as if she were reliving the moment. She told me that her baby, @PERSON2, had a rare disease. Half of his brain was smooth, instead of the the normal rigid. She told me about those first days and how scared she was. Seeing @PERSON2 next her was the only thing that kept me from bursting into tears. He had lived longer. @PERSON1 told me about how as @PERSON2 grew older he couldn't walk. His pediatrician told her that @PERSON2 would never be able to take his first steps and would have to live life confined in a wheel chair. @PERSON2 was given another miracle. He walked. With the aide of a camouflage cane he beat the odds once again. @PERSON1 told me about how @PERSON2 couldn't talk. He only speaks through sign language. She also taught me how to take care of him. He was a normal kid who liked to play with cars and @CAPS2. He wasn't any different then the rest of the kids. This was going to be a roller coaster of a week.  I had only met the @CAPS1 early that @TIME1 when they had arrived to @CAPS4 @CAPS5, a @DATE1 @CAPS4 for disabled kids. I had only known them for a few hours and they were telling me their life story. I got the next week to become best friends with @PERSON2. We went swimming in the river, played with sticks, went on nature walks, even rode a horse. The smile on @ORGANIZATION1's face lit up my day every time I saw it. @PERSON2 got to experience things that a child of his kind would never be able to in a lifetime. We got to go tubing, ride on jet skis, and fish in a stock pond where we were sure to catch something. Having the best time of our lives we parted each night to bed, him in his cabin, and I in my tent. Each night as I left I could hear the family laughing and talking about how great the day was and how much fun we were having. To be a part of making a child happy was the cherry on top of my @CAPS4 experience. One event in particular from @CAPS4 that week will always stay close to my heart. @PERSON2 had been experimenting around on a tricycle made specifically for children with disabilities. He tried for hours to make it go. No matter how hard her tried he couldn't move. My heart broke when I saw him start to cry. He was so frustrated. @PERSON2 gave up and moved on to the swings instead. The rest of the day was filled with the look of sorrow and frustration on his face. I wanted to fix it. I had to fix it. He needed to be happy. That night I went to our @CAPS4 directer, @PERSON3, and I told him about what had happened and he brought me to the garage. The garage was so chaotic and unorganized. I didn't quite understand what he was doing until he emerged with a brand new shiny bike. One with foot straps and supportive seat complete with dragons, and a bell. It was the perfect thing. I was so excited to let @PERSON2 try it out in the @TIME1. The next @TIME1, after a delicious blueberry pancake breakfast, we set off to try out the new toy. This moment was big for @PERSON2 and his parents. He was told he'd never walk, or ever be able to ride a bike, or talk. He had lived through miracles before. He could do it again. @PERSON3 strapped @PERSON2 on the bike, put a helmet on him and started him off. The anticipation was almost too much. After a few seconds passed, the wheels began to turn. @PERSON2 was riding a bike. Tears streamed down our faces, this was the greatest moment of @ORGANIZATION1's life. The way he smiled and laughed at his new found capability was a great sight. To be part of something so special was an honor. @PERSON2 rode his bike all around @CAPS4 that day. He even rode it into his cabin, and continued to ride in circles around his bunk. I left the family to enjoy their night and went off to bed myself.  The rest of the week was filled with a great deal of fun, but when the end came the goodbyes were hard. We didn't want to leave each other. I had become part of @LOCATION1's family, they trusted me and I felt at home with them. @PERSON2 and I were new best friends and couldn't wait until the next @DATE1 when we would meet again at @CAPS4 @CAPS5 where we could do it all over, and make new memories."	47
21606	"One time I was at my friend @PERSON1's house, and her dog @PERSON3 was going crazy. She would run up and down the stairs as fast as she could and no one had any idea why. I thought it was so funny, but @PERSON1 was getting super mad at @PERSON3. So eventually @ORGANIZATION1 into her room to see if she would calm down, but to her dismay @PERSON3 did not. She was running hot laps back and forth all around the room and the more she did that the harder I laughed. It was like the most funniest thing I have ever experienced in my life. This dog had obviously gotten a hold of some kind of energy source to be this happen. Yet we still couldn't figure out what it was, but @PERSON3 was on a sugar high or something. So @PERSON1 and I went down stairs to see if her mom @CAPS1 knew why @PERSON3 was acting so ridiculous. She had no clue. So then we went and asked her dad @PERSON2, and he was convinced the dog was just crazy. Obviously the dog had some issues, but that wasn't the problem because @PERSON3 never usually acted this hyper before. Then @CAPS2, @PERSON1's sister came down stairs and told us to shut the dog up, but we couldn't. @PERSON3 was running to fast to catch her and was way to crazy to try and calm her down. So we took @PERSON3 back in @ORGANIZATION1's room and just laughed and laughed because there was nothing else to do but to sit there and wonder what the heck was wrong with this dog. To be honest, we never did find out what was wrong with @PERSON3, she was just insanely hyper and out of this world that @TIME1. So after @PERSON3 had calmed down about @NUM1 hours later, @PERSON1 and I went on a walk. We were with her friend @PERSON4 and I was trying to explain to him the story of how @PERSON3 went crazy that @TIME1 and they didn't find it as funny as me. I thought it was the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life! And while I was explaining it to him, they had warned me I was about to trip over a curb, but I was laughing way to hard to notice and I fell. That was like the icing on the cake of @TIME1. I just sat there on the ground and laughed, and so did they. It was pretty funny! I haven't laughed that hard since then. The end."	36
21611	" Why is it that people can look back at something and laugh, but not while the action is taking place? For example, if you were to witness someone being hit by a car. During that event, nobody would be laughing. There would most likely be people rushing frantically for help and ambulances everywhere. But we see people get hit by cars all of the time on the @CAPS1 and it is considered comedic. On a hot @DATE1 @TIME1, something quite similar happened to me and my friends.  I live next to the @LOCATION1. I know of this one spot on the @LOCATION1, its called @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. It has a pretty strange name due to the fact that the water is actually a greenish color because the reflection of the tree's that surround it. The @LOCATION1 is about thirty yards wide, nobody knows how deep it is because it is impossible to touch the bottom. The main attraction is a cliff-side, which ranges from @NUM1 feet too @NUM2 feet. On the other side of the @LOCATION1, there is a beautiful, golden beach with massive tree's behind it. The hike to @ORGANIZATION1 is about one mile of steep decline, which leads right to the cliff's edge. The @LOCATION1 bed and the gorge is lined up just the way that it is shaded for most of the day, except in the mornings.  On this particular day, I was going to bring @CAPS2, @PERSON2, @CAPS3, and @PERSON1. My friend @CAPS2 is a dare-devil. Although he's not very good at athletic things, he is willing to try just about anything. He was also home-schooled until freshman year of high school, so he's also pretty socially awkward and definitely not used to resisting resisting negative peer pressure. On the other hand, I am the kid to do crazy things, but I can pull them off. I was doing gainers off of the cliff's edge that was only about @NUM1 feet off the water. Somehow, @CAPS2 ended up getting pressured into trying one as well. As he was getting mentally prepared for this stunt, we all gave him a count down. @NUM4, @NUM5, @NUM6, @CAPS6! We all shouted at the same time. He ran to the cliff-side, just like I showed him, he jumped out, then brought his knee's to his to his chest. Nothing happened! That was the problem, @CAPS2 tucked but he never rotated. He fell like a rock. His back aimed strait at the water. There was what seemed like a @NUM7 second pause between the moment he jumped off the cliff and the moment he smacked the water. His upper back was the first thing to make contact with the water, there was a giant splash, and the sound of a clap almost as loud as a small firecracker. @NUM5 seconds later, @CAPS2 emerged from the water, he was attempting to breathe but no air was entering his lungs. @PERSON2, @CAPS3, @PERSON1, and I were all on the shore of the beach across the lake! Simultaneously, we looked at each other, nobody was laughing, everyone looked worried. All at once we booked it into the water. It was about a @NUM9 yard swim to get all the way to @CAPS2. I was the first one there. He was panting by then, but he was still in an intense state of panic. I stayed away from him until @PERSON1 got there. @PERSON1 is almost 6'@NUM7 and @NUM11 pounds, so he grabbed @CAPS2 around the torso first. I grabbed his legs, when @CAPS3 and @PERSON2 finally got there they took hold of his arms. We all pulled him to the beach where he could safely put his feet on dry land. Who knows what would have happened if the panicked @CAPS2 would have made it to the beach all by himself. Although, it was kind of @CAPS18 fault for pressuring him in the first place.  After almost @NUM5 hours of basking in the in the sun and calming down, the sun started setting behind the gorge, there were shadows closing in on us from the shoreline. It was only @NUM5 @LOCATION2. We decided to explore down the @LOCATION1 a little bit, also to find some more sunshine. We all stood up and noticed that @CAPS2's entire backside was purple! Not only because of his ginger skin, but the impact on the water created quite the contusion. Everyone except @CAPS2 saw it and busted out laughing at the memory of what had previously just happened. @CAPS2 looked behind him and saw his discolored back and couldn'@CAPS3 hold back bursts of laughter. Laughter was coming from everyone.  This was the first time that @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and I had ever hung out. Laughter was what brought us together. Now we share @CAPS18 @LOCATION1 spot with all of @CAPS18 own other friends but nothing sticks out to me like that day did. To this day we all still reminisce about that hot @DATE1 day at @ORGANIZATION1 when @CAPS2 attempted a gainer off the cliff. ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two (or five) people."" "	42
21619	I dont like computers	10
21626	" In most stories mothers and daughters are either enemies or friends, in @CAPS13 story however, we are both enemies and friends well; at one point we were that way. Not @CAPS4 much anymore. I'm sixteen now and she's forty and were just friends, I mean she's still @CAPS13 mom and she still can punish me as her daughter as she pleases but we work it all out and laugh it off. Approximately seven months ago @CAPS13 mom moved from @LOCATION4 to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 I chose to stay behind to finish high school with @CAPS13 current friends. When she moved, the way we acted with eachother would be different, and it is, we act completely different with each other we now cherish the little time we have and I'll explain how. At the beginning since as early as I can remember, @CAPS13 mother and I would always fight over the dumbest things, we never got along. And here is what I think the reason is. I'm her daughter I was born just like her, her face, hair, eyes, everything, even @CAPS13 attitude and the sound of @CAPS13 laugh. She's stubborn I'm stubborn and we both like to argue, not really with other people just with us two, but if we were to go into business together things would get done, say if we became lawyers we'd work great together because I inherited her work ethic and we both like to argue valid points. But as I grew up a bit more and we experienced traumatic times together we began to see the brighter side of life, and that just having each other around is enough to keep us from falling apart. Events in our life that we went through brought us together @CAPS1 it was all finished and done. What I mean by that, is we stopped arguing, we comforted each other when we needed comfort, we became friends, and I believe laughter had a lot to do with it.  @CAPS13 mom, her name by the way is @LOCATION5, once said ""Laughter brings two people together as a whole, the one thing that human beings all know how to do is laugh and its something we can all share."" @CAPS1 our life had settled down and we were able to live normal, like with a house and lights and a dog with a yard, things were good between us we still fought often but never as it used to be. Which would consist of throwing objects across the room at each other, like I said things are better now. We one night discovered, that laughter is something we both use to block out the things we no longer wanted to haunt us. I love to sing, @CAPS13 mother and @CAPS11 had me grow up around music like; The @CAPS2, @LOCATION3, @PERSON2, @PERSON4, and many others but we would sing a song together something that only the two of us shared and it was ""@CAPS3're @CAPS4 @CAPS5"" by @PERSON3. But we would sing that specific song in the car, we would sing it in front of our family and @CAPS1 the moment was over we would laugh about it, because for once was something that only @CAPS13 mom and I shared and it was special. Laughter played a big part of who we are as people today. There are always things people do together, @CAPS13 mom grew up in a strict @CAPS6 @CAPS7 home, she also had four sister's and @CAPS8 was a very serious matter. @CAPS13 mom and I went to @CAPS8 together and we always tried not to take life @CAPS4 seriously all the time, @CAPS4 while in @CAPS8 we would start @CAPS15 about some kind of ugly bug on the wall, or she would laugh at me because I would drop the prayer book on @CAPS13 foot, but we would always laugh."" @CAPS10 it or I'll bring @CAPS11 @CAPS12 over here and @CAPS3'll have to take an extra religion class.""@CAPS13 mom would say as I'm poking her or making fun of her and i would say "" @CAPS14 wont make me take an extra class I'll tell him @CAPS3 started it."" That's who @CAPS13 mom and I were and were still like that. Even though she moved to @LOCATION2 for a new job, and @CAPS4 she could see the man she loves more often than every six months, we still talk, and like I said we laugh when we cry and boy do we cry a lot, especially on the phone when I tell her I miss her.  That is the story of @CAPS13 mother and the laughter that we have shared for the last sixteen years, and to quote @PERSON1 ""@CAPS15 is the best calorie burner."" I do believe that and @CAPS13 mom and I see it as that, @CAPS15 is the one thing we can do when we don't feel @CAPS4 hot or don't feel like ourselves, @CAPS4 yes she is correct when she states that laughter brings two people together, and it's positively true, we have a better relationship than ever."	35
